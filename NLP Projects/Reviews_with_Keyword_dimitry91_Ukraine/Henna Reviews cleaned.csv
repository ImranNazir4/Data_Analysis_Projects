"Even though its an unmanned hotel, its just check-in and check-out, and an unmanned convenience store, so its far from a robot hotel. …",3.2
"5 stars. Its very suitable for families with young children, and everything has good taste (I interpret the name strange hotel as aiming for impact rather than taste lol) Even if there are steps, its tatami mats, so you dont have to worry if your child has trouble sleeping. The equipment is minimal but of good quality. We will use strange hotels all over the country! I like it! ! ! 😆",5
"A clean and spacious business hotel next to Huis Ten Bosch. I wrote in hopes of future improvement, and when I checked in at 3 oclock, the room was not cleaned. Neither the unmanned convenience store nor the unmanned bar could be operated without reading the manual, which was rather inconvenient. Breakfast was delicious, but it was negative that the staff did not get dressed.",1
"A convenient hotel close to Huis Ten Bosch. As for the room Room cleaning was the worst. The floor is littered with sand and hair, and the space for luggage is also dusty. There are futons on the floor, so I dont think its a good idea for those who are fastidious.",1
A fashionable hotel for robots. Innovative concept! I want to go again♪,5
"A hotel run by a robot. Certainly it sounds strange, but in the modern age of computer technology, I was shocked that it was not impossible. In the near future, if you think that the hotel will shift to the robot gradually, it will be horrible.",5
A hotel that can be used as a story because it is just a strange hotel. The room is clean and nice.,4
"A hotel where self-check-in with an inconvenient system is boring. The parking lot near the hotel cannot be used for free, and only the distant parking lot that must use the shuttle bus can be used. I had heard in advance that there was a park ticket discount for hotel guests, but when I asked about it locally, I was surprised to be told to line up at the gate and buy a ticket at the regular price like a day trip user. Even an untrained eye can see that the homepage is not well managed because it is difficult to find necessary information and old information remains. It is also convincing that HIS gave up rebuilding and sold it.",1
A hotel with an interesting concept. I want another impact.,4
A hotel with cheap rooms and services that are not worth the price. You can hear the voices of the customers passing through the hallway and the sounds on the upper floor and next door. The small size of the TV was reluctantly installed in a place where you cant see it well unless you sit on the bed or stand on your knees. It was a disappointing hotel as I had high expectations.,1
"A little pricey, but good for kids",2
a little weird,5
A lot of things were paid and expensive.,3
A modern and beautiful hotel. Thank you for separate bath and toilet. I do not recommend coming to people who are not good at machines. It is a negative point that the toilet smells when entering the restaurant.,3
"A place visited from outside the prefecture for the fireworks display. I would like to come again with my friend next time. I had a problem with the restroom (Im a girl). There was no excuse me. I dont understand why its bad. As soon as I asked Mr. Nikko, who was a few meters ahead, he said, Please, please. I will be staying at Nikko next year. Traveling is about connecting with what kind of people, when, and in what situations... this is also a memory. It was very disappointing.",1
A place where you can enjoy the rarity that is not found in ordinary hotels,3
"A quiet two-story hotel. Amenities were nice It is difficult to use the remote control of the proof subtly I wanted a glass cup instead of just a mug The TV is difficult to see, so I would like it to be in the front.",4
"A robot was in charge of the reception, and a human was mowing the lawn in the garden. I thought that the time when human labor would be replaced by AI and robots might not be too far off.",5
"A robot will guide you, but I had a hard time understanding the explanation of how to use the card key. The room is a normal business hotel and you have to walk outside to the dining area, so if it rains it will be difficult.",2
"A robot will help you at the front desk. interesting. If you use the Huis Ten Bosch parking lot, there is no parking fee, but it may be far from the hotel. Robots will respond, but employees are at the front desk, so you dont have to worry if you have any questions.",4
"A simple hotel surrounded by modern facilities and design. Check-in and check-out were also simple with machines, rational and stress-free.",5
"A small robot greets you with an orchestra at the entrance. Check-in and check-out are done by lifelike women and dinosaur robots. The room is unlocked by face recognition. Only the reception is exciting with a unique atmosphere, but the room in particular is unchanged.",3
A strange hotel where a robot welcomes you! I want you to experience it once,4
"A very comfortable hotel! It has its own parking lot and is very close to Huis Ten Bosch. The restaurant for breakfast in the hotel is healthy and delicious. The room is clean and comfortable, the bathroom is very comfortable, there is a terrace, quiet, very satisfied!",5
"A very novel hotel, allowing everyone to foresee the possibility of the future. And its easy to get to Gauttens. The breakfast is also simple and delicious!",5
"① The building and equipment were new and beautiful ② Check-in and check-out were done by the robot at the front of the hotel, and I thought it was smart and smooth, but it took quite a while. ③ Dinner was a place where I walked in Huis Ten Bosch for about 10 minutes from the accommodation. * There are some other minor troubles, so I think that this hotel will be excluded from the options next time.",3
"①Official hotel of Huis Ten Bosch ②Topic of strange hotel Thats why I thought it was this price without meals. A beautiful, clean and fun hotel. I feel that it is expensive if the ①② element is not necessary. I chose an inn based only on the 2 factors... I felt that it was a little expensive. I enjoyed the check-in event. Good result.",3

If you use the strange hotel guest re-entry gate, you can enter the park without walking to the entry (welcome gate). The word strange, which is the origin of a strange hotel, means change and means continuing to change. You can enjoy a comfortable hotel life at a hotel that has introduced advanced technology. The store was closed due to the application of Priority Measures for Prevention of Spread (January 21st to March 6th, 2022) in Nagasaki Prefecture.

After all it is a strange place 🤮🤮🤮 It did not suit me‼ ️It seems that other families were having fun! ️,2
After all it was strange hotel!,3
After all we think that it is strange hotel.,4
"After all, it is inconvenient if people do not respond. I was in trouble because my hotel room key was broken. I thought I needed someone. Good for training small children. If I do something bad, Ill go to the dinosaur~ (laughs)",3
"After playing until midnight at Huis Ten Bosch, check in. There is a liaison bus with Huis Ten Bosch but there is no during the night so taxi or walk (about 10 minutes). The robots will check in even at night. The room is a bit small but clean and with a thuri. Breakfast was health-oriented but many items were delicious",4
Air input is useless,2
"Although it is a little far from Huis Ten Bosch, there is an exit that allows you to return directly from Huis Ten Bosch. I walk outside to my room, so what about rainy days? maybe There are coin lockers in the parking lot, so you should put your luggage in before going to Huis Ten Bosch before going to Huis Ten Bosch.",3
"Although it is compact, it is beautiful and easy to use. Breakfast is at AURA. Delicious!",4
"Although it is far from the entrance of Huis Ten Bosch, there is a shuttle bus and a dedicated passage to the park, which is convenient.",4
"Although it was a special day, the amount was high. However, it was convenient because it had its own entrance.",3
"Amenities☆☆ Its a rinse-in shampoo, so my hair is dry. Cleaning☆☆ No change of sheets or cleaning of the room. Towels and amenities are exchanged. Fixtures☆☆ There is a pot, but you can buy coffee, tea, etc. from the vending machine on the first floor. The aura of breakfast is ☆☆☆☆ Morning, noon, night buffet, especially night tempura ◎ All the other vegetables were very tasty. However, since the place is a restaurant after going out once, it is inconvenient in case of bad weather. No room service There is a charge for parking Is it good for younger generation? Not recommended for people of a certain age",2
"An eerie hotel that symbolizes the rattling Huis Ten Bosch. Of course, there is no human service. Every move of the lodger is targeted by a robot-embedded voyeur camera. The suspicious good evaluation of this review is the same, but only the Internet measures are excellent. Isnt the one who is deceived a very weak countryman?",1
An unmanned convenience store will open in the hotel soon! Ill let the robot stay at the robots reception desk and at the robots bar someday instead of me!,4
"Anyway, the walls are thin, so I cant sleep because of the noise next door and above and the slapstick in the hallway. I think cheap business hotels have better amenities and tea bags. There is dust in every corner of the room, there is also hair... Guidance from the front desk to the room is also difficult to understand and gets lost. I cant help it because Im using the prefectural discount and its cheaper, but if its the regular price, I definitely wont stay It was a hotel where I could not stay comfortably.",1
"Anyways teeth? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? A hotel. I made a reservation without knowing anything reception in the lobby I never thought Id go outside ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? was. Unfortunately, the weather was warning-grade heavy rain. I searched for the building of the room with a large amount of luggage and two children, but even if I proceeded as instructed, there was no applicable building ww Families making U-turns here and there Like us, he was confused. Guidance to the building is too complicated. I wandered around and managed to reach the room, but I was already exhausted. Even though I know we are staying with 2 children, the loungewear provided is for adults only. No microwave in the room. I will never stay there again.",1
"Apart from the naming, the facilities are also very clean and sufficient. It takes about 10 minutes to go through the welcome gate of Huis Ten Bosch, but its right after passing through the adventure park. There is a robot cloakroom in the hotel, and one can be kept for 500 yen, but the coin locker at the entrance is large and I was able to put 3 carry bags and 1 sports bag in the locker for 700 yen. Breakfast was stated to start at 7:00, but the poster at the front desk changed it to start at 6:30. The breakfast was buffet style and very delicious.",4
"As it is a little away from the station, Huis Ten Bosch, its hard to walk with luggage. The receptionist can check in the robot by voice or touch panel and unlock the room by face recognition as well as cards, and souvenirs, additional amenities and fast food are also sold by vending machines, and there was almost no sign of people. However, since the cleaning person walks at the time of checkout, it was pulled back from the strange hotel of a robot only to a normal hotel. Also, it was a pity that there was no elevator in the facility, it was delicious, but the restaurant was healthy and natural and the theme was not a strange hotel element, and the sensitivity of Tully in the room was too bad to respond to the words.",3
"As the name suggests, it was a strange hotel, and there were many things that bothered me.・There is no elevator and it is difficult to carry a suitcase only on stairs ・The 3D touch panel at the reception does not respond to touch ・The face recognition system at the convenience store does not work and the door cannot be unlocked ・The touch screen in the game corner does not respond well ・Churi recognizes voice I have the impression that the system is generally old, but the room was clean and the breakfast at the restaurant Aura was delicious.",3
"At first I was embarrassed, but according to the familiarity, I was able to spend pleasantly without using my mind. Check-in was easy too.",4
Awesome,4
beautiful and sw,5
"Beautiful, but... There is no toilet door, and the sensor-type electricity goes out quickly... I need a little more maturity...",2
"Because it is 2 days and 1 night, I went with a focus on play! Room is normal. The bath was only a shower, but there was no problem. Floating check-in panel? I was surprised, but it was smooth. We recommend taking a taxi to the hotel at night! Weird hotel guests change through the back streets! It seems that you can go home through the cherry blossoms at night during the cherry blossom season! !",5
"Because my eyes become room keys, I will go into the room alone even if I go outside The Robophone Orchestra is very nice to meet you I made a reservation using D Travel Although reservation was not established Not only the robot but also the staff, I coped and changed the size of the room.",4
"Because there are few products at the unmanned convenience store, if you are thinking of making breakfast easy, you should buy it at another place and bring it in. The convenience store near the entrance to Huis Ten Bosch didnt sell much in the evening.",4
"Because there is a corridor without a roof, bad weather tends to be a problem. It was convenient to enter the room with the face recognition system, but the room was a very ordinary hotel. Air purifiers vary from room to room. There are only basic amenities, and there is nothing convenient to have such as cotton swabs. The small convenience store inside is open until 25:00. Other major convenience stores take about 20 minutes to walk one way, so if you dont plan your stay, youll get lost in the outcrop.",3

Breakfast was also very good. The room was also very nice. The robot support when checking in was also very good❗,5
"Breakfast was delicious! The hotel is new and clean. But I wonder if cleaning is sweet. As soon as I entered the room, there was garbage on the sofa, locks of hair on the floor, A band-aid under the extra bed... The bathroom looks clean at first glance, but there is pink mold here and there. why? It looks pretty because its new now It looks like its going to get dirty soon if the cleaning crew doesnt try a little harder. Its just like home. Clean with a little more love.",3
Breakfast was very good!,5

"Check in and check out is very smooth and easy. The room was spacious, the facilities were good and I wanted to use it again. It took about 5 minutes on foot to the entrance gate of Huis Ten Bosch and every 20 minutes for the shuttle bus.",5
"Check in is cool,beside that,everything is poor,all the basic service I cannot find in this hotel,may be I should say motel , no basic coffee or tea bags , no USB charger plug for me to charge my cellphone, i cannot find any high tech service or basic service in this hotel, I cannot the conditioner so I need to buy , parking is far away, anyway , think twice before to book, one of the important thing, they dont English. Really bad experience",1
"Check in is self-service, but non-Japanese must go to the counter on the far right to operate with a computer, and you cannot find dinosaurs or female robot counters!",3
"Check-in & check-out is handled by the robot. It is divided into a two-story building, “There is no elevator”, so is the staircase a little tight suddenly for tired legs and a tight suitcase? The bathroom is separate from the bathroom with the washing area, so it feels wide. There is an electric kettle, but tea and coffee are charged. I took my usual favorites. Bet making is a fee of 1000 yen. You can clean towels.",4
"Check-in was by air touch display, but there was a feeling of the future and it was very fun (∀ ≦ ノ) The child was afraid of the dinosaurs, but this also became a memory (laughs) As it becomes the making of story of story, it is good to try staying once There is a new feeling of cleanliness and the room is tailored to a very stylish space. For wheelchair users, it is recommended to stay in the Deluxe Twin Room on the second floor of the hotel who has a receptionist. When going to the second floor from the reception, it is a gentle slope, so there is no problem with a wheelchair. Rather, the second floor is the first floor and the first floor is at a lower position like the basement, so if you try to go to the first floor room you will end up using a slope with a steep angle. The deluxe twin room is very accessible because it is accessible to the public, but there are no handrails, and the toilets are not wheelchair accessible, although there is no door. I think it would be okay to stay again as it was beautiful.",5
Check-in was fun. The room was clean and had what I needed.,4
Check-in with a robot pick-up,3
Children enjoyed it as soon as they arrived with face authentication registration instead of room key.,4
Children love it!,5
"Children were happy at the front desk. However, it is not recommended for families with children. Since the building is made like a corporation (lightweight steel frame), the staff complained even though we were not so noisy due to the sound and vibration leaking. (The child slept soundly at that time, but ...?) It is not recommended for those who have energetic children or who want to spend their time quietly. The morning buffet was delicious!",2
"Clean, large room, affordable, novel robot service",5
"Comfort bed and shower. Clean room and nearby environment. Very funny check in experience and the eye Identify system for opening door. Excellent breakfast must try. There is TV , hairblower, slippers etc in the room.Nice stay.",5
Cospa is good. Children are overjoyed. The air conditioning was comfortable without drying.,4
Cospa strongest!,4
"Cost cut hotel rather than weird. Amenities include hair ties and hair caps, no cotton swabs, and shampoo with conditioner. The rooms are small and temporary. There is no kind of breakfast buffet. Anyway, I recommend a different hotel, even if its a little more expensive.",2
"Crowded, small room, robot reception as gimmick",3
"Currently staying. I decided to stay at Hotel Europe because I couldnt get it for a day. At 1 oclock tonight, the walls are so thin that it sounds like snoring in the next room is sleeping together. what! ?? These bag-shaped sheets that you cant put out! I cant sleep anyway. Not healed. Help me.",1
Customers are polite and satisfied.,4
"Despite the not-so-cheap price of ¥18,000 for two people, the footsteps and noises of people upstairs are quite loud. The water pressure in the shower is quite weak and sometimes water comes out. Shampoo is rinse-in shampoo and hair is crispy. I feel disappointed that the cheaper hotels have better service and better soundproofing.",2
Dinosaurs staff is interesting. Its hard to get into a convenience store.,5
"Double room The interior of the room is not large, but it is not small and good. I thought there would be something like a robot that could move around, but it was unfortunate that it was not there, and there are several buildings on the hotel site. There is a smartphone in the room, and international calls are free and you can carry around and use Wi-Fi pairing. Recommended for young people. There is a minimum price for money.",4
Drink vending machines were often sold out.,4

Eat outside for meals and finish the hot springs outside I think its okay if you just sleep! Its close to the gate,5
Enjoyed my stay. Robots all over the place. Especially liked the dinosaurs that check you in at reception. The breakfast was especially good and staff were helpful. I recommend a nights stay for the novelty of it.,4
Equipment is new. The female robot next door can check in more smoothly than the dinosaur at the front desk (personally).,4
"Even though it was on the 2nd floor, there was no EV, so I had to carry a large suit with a small child, which was quite troublesome. A hotel where you can stay once as a story, but you definitely dont want to repeat it",2
Even though there were many students on the school trip I had a quiet time☺️,3
"Everyone was lined up at the reception desk, Dinosaur-kun (≧▽≦)",5
"Except for the bathroom where I was worried about the scale of red mold, it was a clean and beautiful hotel. We stayed on a busy weekend, but thank you for the smooth check-in and check-out. However, since the service is less than a general business hotel, it is recommended that you use it after understanding the correspondence of robots.",4
"Except for the position of the TV, which is difficult to see from one of the beds, there is no dissatisfaction if you do not make a mistake in what you expect as per the previous information.",5
"Face recognition, I couldnt open it in the morning because I was swollen, but it was fun 🎵",5

"For special restaurants, the Chinese and English recognition of the robot needs to be strengthened;)",4
"For the time being, children are delighted with robots! The room is clean and the bathroom is spacious, no complaints. If I dare say it, I would have been happy if there were tea bags such as tea in the room. I was very happy with my breakfast. Breakfast is a buffet style that promotes health with local production for local consumption. There were many things to eat than hotels around here, and it was delicious. I would like to stay again if I come to Huis Ten Bosch.",4
"Free Wi-Fi is garbage Other than that, I was satisfied.",3
"From Huis Ten Bosch, the last shuttle was early .... Its not much of a distance to walk, to the tired feet playing one day Tsuta Kitsuka. In welcome surprise from the hotel counter, personally very happy. It was very interesting. The speech recognition robot in the room does a little more work!",4
"From the robot reception, to the robot porter, and to the room, Tully will help you.",5
Futuristic,5
Going in and out of the room without a key is fine,4
Good,5
Good ^_^,4
"Good for children. Since it was spring break, the morning buffet was crowded. I wonder if the menu is a little unsatisfactory 😅 Family is satisfied. If youre a couple, its a one-ranked hotel 😊",3
"good place ・Separate bath tub and sink ・The breakfast AURA Aura staff was familiar with families and spoke kindly to children. The rest is Business hotel is the price of Huis Ten Bosch. Its not a bad reason, its an idea of ​​personal price standard, If you spend so much money here, choose another hotel! Amenities such as Eco Hotel are only toothbrushes, razors, and two green tea bags, so I thought, Then lower the price. There was an air purifier, a bottle opener, and a deodorant spray like reset! The room had a strong smell of chemicals, probably to remove the smell of something. It is said to be a robot hotel, but the only thing that really helped me was the unmanned robot front desk that operated the buttons at check-in. Also, when I was operating and my personal information was displayed in the air, a customer took a picture from behind me... Im still worried if I didnt take a picture. Face authentication eliminates the need for a card key in the room, but it was faster to take out the card key because it didnt work. There is an unmanned convenience store and a bar, and payment is by credit card. I was able to choose a room rank such as Standard or Superior when making a reservation, but I was glad that I was able to choose the East or West building. I had lower back pain, so staying in a Japanese-style room in the south was dangerous ✌️ The parking lot in front of the hotel is paid and free. The parking lot is a 5-7 minute walk with a slope, and a robot will put your luggage in the locker for a fee, but other hotels have lower prices and amenities and services / large public bath Since there is, I honestly thought that there would be no next time unless the price was lowered. If you are staying at a directly managed hotel with a large number of families and friends, I would like you to splurge a little more and choose Forest Villa ✴️ I think that it is good for people who like unmanned / science.",2
"Good point Robots are novel and interesting Huis Ten Bosch has an entrance exclusively for guests, making entry and exit smooth Where improvement is needed The TV is a tablet → The video is often interrupted and I cant watch it properly. There is free Wifi → Smartphone data communication is faster.",2
"good point The facility was very clean as of the date of posting. The room was spacious and comfortable. Apart from the bathroom and toilet, I personally liked that the home appliances were made in Japan. Amenities are minimal and less than business hotels. In addition, we were able to enjoy using high-tech keys. Accommodation is ★5. bad point Paid parking. For free parking, you have to use the parking lot about 10 minutes on foot. Convenience stores are not convenient. There is a convenience store called Smart Convenience Store, but you can only enter one group at a time, so I had to wait 30 minutes to buy a cup of noodles. The product lineup is similar to that of a high school store, and only card payments are accepted. We recommend that you purchase your food in advance. Unfortunately, it is 1..",3
Great for the family,5
"Half interest, I tried to stay in the exciting half. The correspondence of the staff was wonderful. It may be hard for people who are not used to it, but I like it ♪",3
Have never been to this place,1
"Henn na Hotel on-site parking is charged, please note",5
"Hennna hotel (a strange hotel) If you are looking for a unique experience with this robot themed hotel, then dont. Because it isnt. This hotel is located in rural Kyushu, it has a lobby with a few detached blocks with 20 or so rooms each. The lobby is equipped with a few very fancy vending machines. The rooms are very... Well, Japanese. The room is tiny and over crowded with furnitures , the floor feels strangely halo and crepes with every steps. These problems are understandable and frankly, common among Japanese hotels. But I am more disappointed in its attractions. The first thing you see in the lobby is these robotics hosts that help you check in. They do speak Mandarin, English and Japanese, but they are rather limited in functions. They scan your passport and then give you your room key, essentially a reskined kiosk that you would see in an airport. And before you get into your room, there is an option to scan your face to use the facial recognition instead of the room key. It uses a 2D scanning process, and unlike the face id on the iPhone X, it can be theological deceived by a photo. Although to be completely fair, it is unlikely to be obtained, but the security aspect are still left to be desired. There is this robot room assistant, and it is got to be one of the creepiest thing I have ever seened. I mean just look at it! The voice recognition is inaccurate and it reminded me of siri in beta phrase if even that. Given the fact that most things around us these days are hackable, this thing offers no value other than having an extra set of microphone that listens to you at all time. Like I said this hotel located in rural Kyushu. The nearest supermarket/shopping complex is 5 miles away and the only way to get there is by taxi which cost around 1500 yen. It claims that it offers all the necessities that you need but it is highly debatable. This is the first hotel I have stayed in that offers disposable razors yet no shaving cream. And there is no bottled water to found in the room, I would have been okay with this if water in the vending machines downstairs didnt cost twice as much as outside. The reason I didnt give this hotel a one star is solely because its breakfast is actually not bad all things considered. So what we have is an hotel that when striped of its gimmicks, is just an mid tier Japanese hotel that costs a lot more than it should.($150USD) so I would advise you to stay away from this one and frankly, there are much better option right next door... Cough cough... The hotel was half empty at the end of the June so yeah... Take that what you may...",2
Hotel room is face pass by face recognition!,4
"However, the front is a robot, after that it feels like an unmanned convenience store in China. The robot is not walking around, which is considerably disappointing than I expected 😢 The room is simple and the amenities are moderate, and it is difficult to move to the room even if it rains The night view is beautiful, but if you dont lower the blinds, you can see the inside of the room from the huge window, which is not the case. The unit bath and toilet are the same as the water around the house. This amount is just too high, isnt it? Ill never stay again. Its a really strange hotel with good disappointment.",2
"Huis Ten Bosch is the only hotel with Japanese-style rooms. I have small children so this is very helpful. And very cheap and beautiful. The front seems to be a little slow to respond, but I didnt mind it too much because it was a robot opponent lol",5
"I also wanted a mirror in the bathroom. The check-in was unmanned (robot compatible), but (of course) the breakfast the next day was completely manned. It would be nice if there was a robot to serve and clean up recently. But it was fun to watch the robots luggage storage.",3
I am sorry that person came out immediately at reception desk. Beer spills too.,4
"I arrived at the hotel earlier than planned due to the rain, and my childs head was soaking wet, so I tried to borrow a towel, but was refused to wait until check-in. The service of the hotel staff was very unpleasant because it was an image that I could reach the itchy place. The child caught a cold the next day. It will be an unforgettable memory. Well, if the weather had been fine, I dont think I would have felt this bad.",1
"I decided to go to Huis Ten Bosch, so I stayed at this famous hotel. When I entered the front desk, the robot responded as expected, and there were many robots in the lobby. Some of the shops are completely unmanned, and they sell anything from vending machines (Times Car Sharing can be done completely unmanned, so it was set up for sale, but I think its a surprise to those who dont know. As a regular user, I was not surprised.) I felt that they were putting effort into unmanned operation. I had high hopes because the price was quite high, but surprisingly there are no weird elements in the room. There were few amenities and I was disappointed. There is a rumba in the corridor of the guest room, but basically it is normal except for the lobby, so if you expect too much, you may be disappointed. However, the lobby alone is interesting, so if you go to Huis Ten Bosch, I think its worth staying at least once. Personally, I like construction work, but the fact that the construction of the third building was being carried out in a hurry was a little disheartening...",3
"I didnt expect much when I went to Henn na Hotel in Tokyo in August, but Huis Ten Bosch was good ♥ Its a pity that there are no places to eat nearby~",5
I do not like so much,2
"I dont think its weird, but its a good hotel.",5
"I expected too much to see how strange it was in me, and I was disappointed because it was too ordinary. I dont know if the room smelled like mold or wood, but it smelled unpleasant. The room was relatively quiet on the first floor on the road side, but it was small for the site. The proof was also dim, and I thought it would be nice to make it a little brighter. The location of the outlets around the bed and the space where you can put things are wonderful. My husband cant sleep when the pillow changes, but he said the pillow here was good and slept quickly. Although it is far from the station, I am very happy with the direct entrance. We recommend that you use the convenience store in front of the station.",3
"I feel that the last pick-up time of the free shuttle bus is around 19:00, which is quite early... It takes about 15-20 minutes on foot. I have luggage, so is it a little tight? Thanks to the robot, check-in is smooth, but its a little confusing because the rooms are in different buildings. Breakfast is a bit pricey... Overall it was clean and I am satisfied.",4
"I forgot my vaccination certificate and the travel support was delayed, but I was able to support my trip safely thanks to your kind advice and support. Thank you very much. Breakfast was also delicious.",5
"I go to Huis Ten Bosch almost every year, but this was my first time using this place. I was worried about breakfast, but it was so delicious that my daughter had another meal, and I ate rice and bread! The rice was not very tasty, but I was satisfied. The room was clean. However, the walls were thin and there were many children, so I was worried about the noise next to and above. Later, I smoke, but I thought it would be nice if each building had a smoking area. It was raining, so I was frustrated because I couldnt smoke.Smokers always want to smoke wherever they go, and it is difficult to find a smoking area in the hotel.",4
I had a good rest,4
"I had a lot of trouble at the reception (´-｀) However, I was excited about the dinosaurs that children love, and the room was a Japanese-style room, so I was able to relax and have a good time. We planned to stay for two nights and stayed at a strange hotel on the first day and in the park on the second day. The walls are thin and you can hear the sound, but it has everything you need and the bathroom is spacious, so I personally like this hotel. I also bought an annual pass, so I will go with my mother and child. It was delicious, so we will definitely be repeat customers (*^^*) Anyway, I hope the corona wont end. Im looking forward to the tulips. Also, I want to enjoy the aura of the night, so Im looking forward to the day when I can eat.",5
"I had children with me, so I really enjoyed it. It was a hotel where I really didnt meet the employees (・∇・)",4
"I have stayed many times, and every time I can find that the hotel is constantly improving. Although it may not be what the tourists need, at least there is a desire for improvement, which is worthy of appreciation!",5
I have trouble when asking questions because there are no people,3
I like this hotel and maintenance but a thing is that I didnt understand japanese and most of the robot prefer Japanese instead of English.,4
I liked the concept. I dont understand the meaning of placing The Zone because the sound is too small.,4
"I love everything with robot but English language is not really available, Google Translate would work though.",5
"I ran into the students of the whole high school, and it was noisy. However, I had a lot of fun at Huis Ten Bosch! I was happy to be able to enter 15 minutes early and see the opera company!",4
I really did not see the staff only with the robot,4
"I really took care of it. The robot will do the procedure at check-in. (I wonder if it will soon disappear.) Because there are few parking lots, if you cant stop, you have to park at the parking lot of the main body of HTB. From there, it becomes a walk. About 10 minutes on foot. If you can catch a taxi, it is easier to catch it. The restaurant is very crowded during the summer holidays. There is a system that allows you to register your mobile number and have you call it when it arrives, so you can wait in the room. HTB fireworks can be seen from the hotel",4
"I stayed at Henn na Hotel for two nights and three days with a plan that included breakfast. Both the robot at the reception and Tully in the room are not very good, but I still enjoyed it. The breakfast buffet restaurant is very good.There are many items, it is clean, and the seasoning is light. I think that it will be a big problem if you cover the Nagasaki Lantern Festival and other events, so please shift it a bit. I think youll enjoy it a lot",3
"I stayed at the hotel using the prefectural discount, but I needed to show proof of vaccination. Please note that if you forget it, you will have to pay the regular fee. Reception at the front desk is done by dinosaurs and androids. I was impressed by the realistic movements. The lodging building is a little far from the front desk, and generally passes through the outdoors. Also, there is basically no elevator, so if you are staying on the second floor, you will have to climb the stairs or come around from the building with the elevator. The interior of the room was mainly wood and white, and I liked it. Enter the park through the gate and exit to the adventure area.",3
"I stayed at this hotel to go to Huis Ten Bosch. It was a concept that robots would do everything, such as check-in, but it was safe because there were employees. The guest room where I stayed this time was a room with a long depth, and it was unified with stylish making such as a sofa. The bathroom was also spacious, but it was a little inconvenient because the toilet and washroom were one. The breakfast was a buffet style with a wide variety and was delicious. I asked for the room to be cleaned on the second day, but there was no change of bed sheets or preparation of new tea, so when I entered the room, I was worried that it had not been cleaned. There is an unmanned convenience store and a strange bar in the front building. Each guest room and dining room are in a building separate from the building where the front desk is located, so you will need an umbrella on rainy days. Huis Ten Bosch can be entered 15 minutes before opening through a dedicated entrance, but it is a little far from the main gate and dark at night.",4
"I stayed at this hotel when I used Huis Ten Bosch. Above all, this hotel is located on the premises of Huis Ten Bosch, so access is very convenient. A feature of this hotel is that there is no human staff. * Of course Im in the background (laughs) You will be taken care of by a dinosaur robot that will work as a receptionist instead of a human, and a robot bartender who will make alcohol at the bar. Other than that, we are thoroughly unmanned, and all facilities such as convenience stores and karaoke in the hotel are operated unmanned. Regarding the important room, I think it cant be helped because other parts are costly, but compared to other hotels in the same price range, the room is small and the interior is simple with an emphasis on practicality. It was something. However, I think its worth staying at this hotel just to experience the evolution of technology and the feeling of the near future.",5
"I stayed for the first time, but I struggled a bit with check-in, but it was quite fun. The bed was comfortable and quiet at night, except for the small room.",3
"I stayed for the first time. I can stay with a little attraction feeling. There are unmanned reception and BAR in lobby, and story robot Chiri-chan in the room. There are many things that can not be experienced elsewhere. The hotel is an apartment type. If there is a problem or there is a question, the person will respond, so it will be interesting once! I personally, but I always stay in the park, so I felt that travel was far.",3
"I stayed here because I thought it would be a good topic to talk about, but I checked in with my luggage because the cart that automatically carries my luggage is closed during the winter. I feel like I was immediately disappointed. In addition, the iris authentication in the room did not work well, so I ended up using only the card key. There is a smart speaker called Tully in the room, but to be honest, Siri and Google Assistant are too good to be new. If there is at least a simple chat function, I dont think children will get bored for a while. To be honest, I felt that it would be better to stay at another hotel and just stop by for a tour. Facilities and meal as hotel are suitable for price and are not dissatisfied.",3
"I stayed in a Japanese-style room As soon as I got there, I lay down on the futon, and no matter how I looked at it, there was hair that didnt belong to me. hair on tatami mats If your room is dirty, shouldnt you put a roller over it? If the labor cost is floating with robots, please hire someone who is good at cleaning. Also, the TV is far away and the screen is small, so its hard to see When I first arrived at this hotel, the only thing that made me happy was seeing the robot.",1
"I stayed on January 1st. I entered the room in a new building that I made in December, with a good feeling of smell of wood and dried it over heating, so I didnt go to the front of the separate building without a phone call to the room without looking for a humidifier. Moth",2
I stayed on my honeymoon ♪,5
I think check-in by robot is interesting and good.,4
I think it is a very beautiful and fun hotel.,4
"I think its a good hotel for a reasonable price, but as an official hotel of Huis Ten Bosch, there were many things that were disappointing. Unfortunately, it was quite a rainy day on the day of our stay, but many of the buildings had to go outside at once, and there was no roof over the passageway, so for some reason I was soaking wet even though I was in the hotel. became. There is no laundry service to wash wet clothes, and among the vast hotel buildings, there is only one washing machine and one dryer in the building farthest from the center. I was in a lot of trouble because I couldnt use it. The room feels like a normal hotel, nothing special. All the staff members were kind and exchanged. Breakfast was good too.",2
I thought AI would do everything It looks like an ornament and is not good. Like an AI imitation. But the performance of the robot is applause. 👏👏👏 Look forward to the future.,3
"I thought I didnt like it at first on the tour, but it was all right. The room was spacious and beautiful, and the bath was a room bath, but I was slowly soaked in the bath. The guide board from Huis Ten Bosch is hard to understand anyway. I didnt really understand Google Navi either, so it was a bit tough to carry my luggage up the hill after playing. If something goes wrong, humans will take care of it. I wanted to eat sweets, but the convenience store was unmanned, so it was a pity that it was only credit. I want you to pay with your room key and pay together after checkout.",3
I thought it was a hotel room or a room in an apartment.,4
"I thought that the reception would be handled only by Robo, and a hotel man came and gave me polite advice. The reception is recommended at the dinosaur place. The lobby and rooms are clean. I made it a double room, but it seems that the instant water heater, humidified air purifier, and refrigerator are permanently installed. Is there a wine opener and a corkscrew to get Huis Ten Bosch souvenirs? If you bring chopsticks and plates from home, you can eat warm food in the microwave in the lobby. Im happy to care. The attached bath is a unit bath like a general household. There are toothbrushes, cups, T-shaped shavings, and plastic combs. The point to be worried about is that you can see it from the outside unless you close the curtain. When I came back from the exclusive doorway from Huis Ten Bosch, I was in full view.",5
I thought the location was great. Our room turned out to be very nice. Hotel is just next to train station. Check out process is easy. Used the robot porter (serves Block A only) Room security was high tech with face recognition security available. Check in was smooth. My favorite part was the hotels breakfast buffet.,5
"I took the robot with the entrance, the front of the dinosaur, the interested child. Not getting used to check-in, I was indebted to people. There were about 2 to 4 rooms in the room, and the inside was clean. Electricity and air conditioning talk to Tully, but it is not easy to answer. Future improvements will be necessary. My child was scared of Thrillertown in Huis Ten Bosch, so I do not know if I can go to Huis Ten Bosch in the future. Im sorry.",4
"I tried dinosaur check-in and it was fun but difficult. The room was very simple, and because it was cheap, there werent things that would normally be in a hotel, but it wasnt inconvenient. The bathtub is very large. The breakfast buffet is a menu that looks really good for your body, and there are plenty of salad dressings. Measures against infectious diseases (wearing gloves, masks required, plates not being reused) were also taken. From the hotel there is a gate to enter the adventure park. It is convenient because it is within walking distance.",4
I used it at the end of the year from Okinawa. It was fun at a very exciting facility for serving only robots. It was a shame that the parking lot was charged.,4
"I used it because it was the cheapest hotel in Huis Ten Bosch. The response from the hotel was quite good, and I was able to use the prefectural discount at the last minute, so I was able to stay at a very cheap price. The inside of the hotel wasnt strange at all either (laughs), and it was very comfortable! It was comfortable! It was so great that I wanted to stay even if I didnt use Huis Ten Bosch! !",5
"I used it before Christmas. At the entrance of the room I was greeted by a wreath. It was a credit card payment, so it was a robot reception (unattended). If you do face recognition, you can also enter the room with face recognition. You can get a free ticket for the nearby Huis Ten Bosch Onsen ♨️, but it was received by a manned person. smile The second floor of the two-story building was calm with woodgraining. If you point your camera at Domtorn, youll see something shining in the viewfinder. Enjoyable for 2 people Recommended is the second floor of D E zone where you can see the light up Room (E is closest to breakfast). There is also a mini shop and minibar. By card or pay payment than cash.",4
"I used it for the first time in the Nagasaki citizen discount campaign in March. As I heard from rumors, the dinosaurs and robots at the front were quite spectacular and fun. It was also very cute to bow my head at the end 😊 Hologram floating in the air? The keypad like this is advanced and impressed! I entered it while fighting with my family lol Its a pity that I forgot to take a picture of my room because my child was exhausted. It was a very large and nice room! Breakfast was also delicious. I would like to use it again if I have the opportunity 😊",5
"I used it on a trip with my two children 🏨 The room is spacious and clean, and the reception is futuristic. The receptionist is a dinosaur bellboy🦖 My child was pretty happy and it was a good trip❕",5
"I used the added waist arm of the strange hotel. I was impressed with how compact it was. The facial recognition for opening the door didnt work. It was moderately inconvenient for me, but depending on the person, it might be too simple and confusing? I would like to use it again.",4
"I walked a little after leaving Huis Ten Bosch, but it was simple, clean and very nice! The breakfast buffet was also very healthy and delicious! Although it was during GW, it was more reasonable than other hotels and I was satisfied!",4
I want to go there again!,5
I wanted to stay again. It was a lot of fun and my kids were happy.,5
"I was a little nervous about checking in when there was no one around. This time, I had reserved two rooms at a travel agency, but when the representative entered my name, the second room was not available, so I asked the staff to come to me without knowing. It was my first time, so it was a little hard to understand 🤔 The room was generally clean. However, since I had two children, I would have been happy if it was a little more spacious. I had seen the size beforehand, but when I actually stayed, it felt small, so if I use it next time, I would like to get a larger room. The breakfast buffet was delicious 😊",3
"I was able to check in smoothly with the guidance of a dinosaur and a beautiful sister robot. Draft beer was also good. The room is clean and the view is great! Unfortunately, the walls are thin and you can hear the voices and footsteps of the neighbors. Other than that, there are no particular problems.",3
"I was able to enjoy the reception, but Chuli who was in the room was sick and annoyed.",3
"I was able to stay very cheaply with a discount in Nagasaki Prefecture. Tullys robot that used to be in the room was no longer there. Its a robot hotel, but there was a person at the reception, probably only at this time, but it felt a little businesslike. The room was large, but it didnt look very clean because there was dust in every corner. The bedding was nice though. Its scary when you return from Huis Ten Bosch at night because the road is so dark. There was a limousine bus near the gate, so I used that one this time. Morning was a buffet, but for the price. . . Impression. Although it is an interesting hotel called a robot hotel, I feel that it is a little wasteful. If it was a little cleaner, I would have given it 4 stars.",3
"I was interested and came to Huis Ten Bosch with my two grandchildren. Within 10 minutes on foot from Huis Ten Bosch, Dinosaur Front-kun took care of me, and my grandson was happy.",5
"I was nervous about what kind of hotel I would go to. Several two-story buildings are connected by passages, and from the outside it looks like an apartment. If you register face authentication with the card key first, you can go in and out without the key. It was convenient, but the room is really small. It was a twin room, but it was impossible to open the suitcase between the bed and the wall at my feet. Maybe the walls are thin Theres a TV on the side of the bed Where do you see this TV from? When. It says that you can enter Huis Ten Bosch from the side, but you have to walk to the front more than the side. I stayed for several nights and asked them to clean it, but I was like, What did you do? . Once I go there, I feel like Im good enough.",3
"I was personally happy that it wasnt a unit bus, and I thought it was a high point. Tully in the room didnt react to me.",3
"I was surprised that there were no people and the machines were cleaning. The free parking lot was a bit far and I had a hard time finding the parking lot. Breakfast was served at the adjacent restaurant, but there were people there. I used home grown vegetables and everything was fresh and very delicious.",5
"I was worried about the sound of running in the childrens room on the second floor, but it cant be helped because Im at Huis Ten Bosch. Breakfast was delicious and satisfying.",3
I went on a school trip. Tully is ignored (laughs),4
"I went to a strange hotel! The robot at the front desk is famous, but among them, I accepted the most impactful dinosaur staff robot on the left. The 3D keyboard floating in the air is novel, but I cant type well (sweat) Tips for entering well are written next to the keyboard, and if you get used to it, you will be able to enter, but I thought that elderly people could not enter reliably. However, it is an interesting experience, and I would like you to try it by all means. The hotel itself is all built like a two-story apartment, and although it is a low-rise building, it has an elevator, which is a sense of luxury, or a wasteful structure. The room itself is normal, but very new and clean. The view varies depending on the direction, but I could see Huis Ten Bosch well from the room where I stayed. As written in other reviews, the parking lot next to the hotel is charged, so you need to park in the Huis Ten Bosch guest parking lot and free the parking ticket at the front desk. I left my ticket in the parked car, so I had to make two round trips. It takes about 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to the parking lot, but there is also a circulation bus. It was a hotel I wanted to stay at once because children can enjoy it, but next time I think Ill do it around the watermark.",4
I wonder if I expected too much... 💧💧💧,3
"I wondered if it was just the front robot for the meeting, there are robots all over the lobby! When I go next time, I hope that there will be more robots in my room, and I would like to improve the morning restaurant, which I did not like.",5
"If possible, I would like to have a pub or restaurant nearby.",4
"If you are attracted to the fun of the robot experience, you will miss it! Check-in is also super hotel or Richmond Unattended check-in is more advanced, faster and more convenient. It seems that the robot that should be in the room has been removed, and there is nothing! The room is small and dark, and the Toyoko Inn is much more comfortable. It looks like a prefabricated shack to be honest. Everything is half-finished, and on the contrary, it is a series of inconveniences. I tried an unmanned convenience store and a weird bar, The lowest level that betrays imagination. For that reason, the accommodation fee is expensive, and you can enter from the exclusive HT entrance There are only a few benefits...",1
"If you go once, there is no second time.",2
If you like computers and robots then you will definitely like this place. I dont like that kind of stuff so I felt uncomfortable. Also if you like to sleep with 2pillows then you will be disappointed. My husband went and asked to get some extra pillows. Basically the stay at this hotel was good. But I would rather not go back because of the robots.,3
"If you want to introduce a robot, let it stop at around 4000 yen",1
"If youre looking for a room-only inn, check-in is virtual, so its fun, but its a little difficult.",4
"In strange hotels, strange people are also present",3
inconvenience,1
Innovative and very comfortable.,5
Innovative system Was clean,4
interesting,4
interesting,5
"Interesting concept. Good fun place to bring the kids to. It is located right next to Huis Ten Bosch so it is a good place to stay if you are visiting the theme park,",5
Interesting Expect further changes,4
Interesting from the reception!,4
Interesting hotel robots etc... The room was nice but the bathroom was smelly. Tuli chan had trouble speaking English.,3
"Interesting hotel. Although I have a convenience store, I felt that the number of products was small. I think it is worthwhile to stay at one time.",2
interesting reception,5
interesting! ️,4
"interesting, a hotel where only robots work",5
"Is so nice, but the robot is slow",3
It contributes not only to accommodation but also as a place to enjoy Nagasaki. Should I visit first?,5
"It covers a wide area, and the scenery is very beautiful during the day and at night. The scenery is even more beautiful at night, and you can play in it all day, which is great",4
"It depends on whether robots, which have not yet been replaced by humans, can be accepted as entertainment. The building is new, but I feel that it is inferior to a general hotel in terms of software.",3
"It didnt feel like a robot as I expected. Be careful as the room is hit and lost. Ive stayed several times, but Im disappointed with the difference between a clean room and a poor room. It is the worst with hard ammonia from a strangely sour and musty room or bathroom. Food juice and dregs on walls and floors ... I cant get it at all even if I reset it The first floor is very noisy because the footsteps are so noisy Only the restaurant is always beautiful. Breakfast was fresh and delicious with vegetables, so I refilled it. As for infection prevention measures, every time I finished eating, the chairs and other parts were blown up to the smallest detail and cleaned.",2
"It feels like I jumped at it in July 2016 out of curiosity. I enjoyed Robot, but I wont repeat it. I feel lonely. Its going to be a world that cant be helped because its labor cost reduction and declining birthrate, isnt it? AI is convenient, but it is also an idea to reduce the amount of body movement. I hope it doesnt end up being horrible...",3
"It is a beautiful business hotel feeling It is good because it is reasonable Thoroughly no tea pack in the room Also, the TV is too small compared to the room ... The bad thing is that the robots motion is slow, so it takes time ... Face recognition of convenience store in the hall was serious It is good for the screen to float in the space of the dinosaur side of check-in, but the operation recognition accuracy is too bad ... After that, the vending machine in the building is disappointing about the price setting of about 50 yen increase Even if the labor cost is reduced, the maintenance cost of the robot may be incurred (laughs)",4
It is a hotel that has truly changed,3
"It is a much-talked-about hotel. Many two-story hotels are lined up, but there is no elevator. The smoking area is outside, so it may be a bit difficult for smokers. There are many kinds of buffet in the morning, and I think it is for young people.",3
It is a rare hotel that the price is low and a robot or a customer is served. The comfort of the room etc. is a good person and can enjoy a sense of luxury for the price.,4
"It is a unique accommodation that is hard to find easily. Inside was spacious and clean. Is it just that the parking fee is excessively expensive? It is recommended to park in the 1st and 2nd parking lots, about 5 minutes away.",4
It is a very unique hotel. Check-in is OK because the robot will be the reception desk. It is up to you to choose which.,3
"It is an impression of a wheelchair user who is always shortening the time, so it is not helpful & there is a possibility that there is a fault here, so please do not swallow it. First of all, reception. Hard to understand. .. It was too difficult for analog humans to understand. .. Maybe because Im in a wheelchair, it didnt look like it was tall, but I wasted time because I didnt know which touch panel to use. I wonder if the operating machines could not be unified into one. The height of the reception is also difficult for wheelchair users to operate. I dont know why wheelchair users find it difficult to use because it is premised that wheelchair users have an assistant or because they overlooked the information board. However, I dont understand because the display is too simplified as a whole. .. And the room. The barrier-free room was uselessly expensive, but it was so small that the wheelchair hit the wall or something between the toilet and the bath, which was difficult. .. Although it is a wheelchair with a small turn, it is a one-way street even though it is a barrier-free room. I wonder if this barrier-free room is not for wheelchair users ... Its just that there are no steps. Also, I was surprised that I didnt even have mineral water, instant coffee, or even instant tea. I thought that the cost would be reduced too much because there was no welcome drink due to AI. Breakfast was included, but other hotels have a paper in the room telling me when and where to go, but at the reception, I dont have it. I looked for it, but I didnt. It may have been a mechanism to see it on the built-in smartphone, but I didnt have that much time, so I felt unfriendly to people who didnt have time and machine-on-chi. The content of the room is high for a wheelchair user traveling alone without an assistant. Its too expensive. The general guest rooms of Hotel Nikko in Kumamoto were definitely better. Although it overlaps, the display of the room information is difficult to understand and it is a problem if there is no staff. .. I felt that the world should not be converted to AI. Not warm, too mechanical. .. It is necessary to confirm in advance for wheelchairs + I made a phone call because of this mistake (I forgot to check out), but since it is a 0570 dial, the all-you-can-call plan is not applicable, and the telephone bill is uselessly costly It is. Since it is not directly connected to a strange hotel, it takes time to connect with the operator. From the facility side, waste may be eliminated, but the user side is full of waste (subjective to the last) If it was manned, it would have prevented me from forgetting to check out ... Well, forgetting to check out is completely bad here. LOL After telling that, of course, he said he would come back to a strange hotel. Moreover, there is a time limit of 11 oclock. Im already in Huis Ten Bosch, its far from Huis Ten Bosch to a strange hotel with a wheelchair, and I cant get on the shuttle bus ... I was told to take a taxi, but how much money do you want to spend? ← It cant be helped because its this fault Im sorry that the checkout was 100% bad, and I didnt want to say that I was a disabled person like a right ... Although it was mentioned in the word of mouth, it is far from Huis Ten Bosch. Of course I moved by car. I have to pay 2300 yen for the parking lot, and I dont understand the system at all. When I inquired about the parking lot by phone, I was told that if I could go to the hotel, I would handle it ... but no one! have become. Also, the strange hotels telephone response was from 9 am, and its quite annoying for someone like me who checked out early in the morning and made a mistake. The hotel with people is the best. I tried to find a good place, but if I say it strongly, it is suitable for training for self-propelled wheelchair users. The skin of my hand has peeled off. I might have repeated it in the bipedal era, but ... I will never use it again.",1
"It is an inconvenient hotel than saying ... strange We used twin by two women, but it took time in the morning at work just because there was one small mirror in bathroom restroom in room In addition, a talking robot is placed in the room, but I can not understand the words, so lets see",1
"It is an unmanned hotel on the outskirts of Huis Ten Bosch. There are very few people for emergencies and reception of home delivery, but basically it is unmanned. I arrived earlier than the check-in time, but there is no luggage storage until the check-in time, so I need to deposit it in the coin locker management industrial robot in the lobby. The room is very clean. If you talk to Tully in the room, it will turn off the lights, but the voice recognition is not that good, so it often fails. The success rate may be higher in English mode. Once you get used to the face recognition system in the room, it was very convenient that you didnt need a key. A wide variety of robots such as cleaning robots, window cleaning robots, and transport robots were working in the museum. In addition, some robots with AI functions were introduced in the lobby. In addition, there were many strange hotel goods in the souvenir vending machine.",4
"It is close to Huis Ten Bosch, so if you like robots, you may want to stay at least once.",3
"It is completely clean and the indoor air is good, but you can breathe the fresh air of nature by opening the window. Its fun to talk to the robots. In particular, the breakfast is not too salty and it is so delicious that I start to overeat in the morning. The staff are also really friendly When I go to Huis Ten Bosch, I will definitely go to the Henn na Hotel ^^",5
It is easy to understand the way to the hotel in detail. You can experience advanced technology.,4
"It is far from the guest parking lot of Huis Ten Bosch. The reception at the front desk is fun. Moving to the room, there is no roof on the aisle on the 2nd floor, so it seems to be difficult on a rainy day. Its a pity that Churies robot in the room is gone. It may be unavoidable because the form has changed.",3
"It is futuristic, and the service that is different from other hotels is very attractive!",4
"It is good to have check-in, a robot and a room, and talk.",4
It is interesting in a hotel where there are no people (not in sight).,5
"It is located outside Huis Ten Bosch Garden, about an 8-minute walk to Huis Ten Bosch. There is also a re-entry gate for hotel guests only. The hotel reception is a robot, and the non-contact display feels unfamiliar, but if you complete the payment at the time of reservation, you can check in in 2-3 minutes. If you dont know what to do, dont worry, human staff are always on hand. There is an unmanned convenience store near the front desk where you can purchase snacks and amenities. (Card payment only) Rooms are simple. The key is a card and face recognition. The hair dryer did not suit my hair, so if you are concerned about it, you should bring it.",4
"It is more convenient to go from there because there is a road where you can go directly to the hotel from the parks adventure park, rather than taking a shuttle bus or foot from the exit.",5
It is normal for high,2
"It is not enough for robots only. Even if you do not understand something, you can not solve without calling the staff. Robots cant talk! It is only a facility that can only stay overnight",2
It is strange,2
"It is very strange that the facility is very clean and the robots work as staff. If there is a problem, our staff will come and respond immediately. We have a Korean staff and can respond quickly.",4
"It looked interesting and cheap, so I gave it a try. Its different from a normal hotel from check-in, so I think you can definitely feel that its a strange hotel. The dinosaur on the left uses an aerial display, and you can experience what you often see in science fiction by typing on a keyboard displayed in space, so I think science fiction lovers and children will be excited. However, the sensitivity is not very good, and you may not be able to input as you want, so it may be a little frustrating for those who are impatient or when there are people in line behind you. The room is relatively ordinary, but it is very clean and the bath is usually large, so you can relax. There are bars and shops, but cash is basically not accepted, so I dont think cash-based people can use them. Breakfast is served in a building away from the lobby, but this is a buffet-style restaurant where people normally serve customers, and you can enjoy delicious and healthy meals. You can enter Huis Ten Bosch directly from the gate at the back of Adventure World, but you need an admission ticket such as a passport, so you need to enter from the main gate first. Once you get the admission ticket, you can enter and exit as many times as you like, which is convenient. All official hotels are expensive, so I highly recommend them for those who want to stay cheaply.",4
It may be difficult to move a little on rainy days,3
"It may be good because it is cheap and you can stay. The bathroom is separate from the washroom and the toilet, so it was great because I could fully soak in the bathtub. The walls are thin and I could hear voices from the corridor and the room next door.",4
It may be the shape of the future business hotel,4
"It may be very good for people who are not good at dealing with people. Everything is enough with robots, vending machines and smart convenience stores.",5
"It says that a negative certificate is required, so when I inquired at the front desk, I was told that a certificate was required and a notice was not acceptable. Cancel reservation once In other prefectures, a notice was fine, so just to be sure, the next day I asked the Nagasaki Prefectural Tourism Division and was told that a notice would be fine. If you try to make a reservation again, it will be fully booked! When I explained the situation to the front desk, they prepared a room for me. However, perhaps because we responded softly, there was no mistake on the part of the other party, and there was no apology. To the site, I was sent to the worst room Some stains on the wallpaper dripping from the ceiling The table cannot be used in a triangle A wall-mounted TV only looks like black and white when you look at it while lying in bed Face recognition rate is bad My neighbor couldnt get in so I was waiting for my partner Even if I ask the cleaning person, I can not set it after all What is this room! The parking lot is coin parking and costs about 550 yen per hour. There is no free parking unless you go to the front of Huis Ten Bosch information Shuttle buses run infrequently, so I ended up walking in hot, humid, downpours. The strange hotel reception that I was hoping for Only here where there was a robot I received various explanations from a normal human I didnt find anything strange about the hardware that I expected, although there are many strange things that I didnt expect!",1
It seems that there are only two staff members.,3
"It seems to be Japans first non-contact AI hotel, but... there are people and they will help you, but its a shabby store that is a convenience store (only accepts credit cards) The vending machines are expensive... All the buildings are two stories The breakfast buffet venue has no roof, so it might be difficult when it rains.",1
It takes about 3 minutes from the exit of Huis Ten Bosch. The reception will be supported by dinosaurs and Android moths. Room was beautiful and was wide by bath and toilet.,5
It took a long time to check in,3
"It took time to leave my luggage, but it was fun.",4
It was a clean hotel. I was puzzled by Tully in the room...,4
It was a good hotel,5
It was a good hotel.,5
"It was a Japanese-style room, but it was very beautiful and I was happy. I am very satisfied.",5
It was a new and beautiful facility. I thought that Churie-chan in the room had low sensitivity. It was interesting because many robots were in close proximity. The breakfast is delicious and delicious. There is a shortcut from the hotel to Huis Ten Bosch.,4
It was a pleasant hotel,5
"It was a rainy day. It was bad that I did not check the location, but it was far from the entrance of Huis Ten Bosch, as it climbed. Room was fun at reception of robot at the time of check-in, but elderly people who came earlier seem to not know well, and employee went out and taught. The room was small but new.",4
"It was a strange hotel. The layout of the room is strange and the TV is right next to the sofa, so you cant watch TV from the sofa unless you are in a strange posture. The rooms and facilities were very simple and surprising because there was no USB power supply for customers to use even though the room was equipped with a smartphone, and there was no deodorant spray or air purifier. Beer is automatically poured from the bottom of the glass at a strange bar When I tried to drink a rare beer, the beer did not come out due to a problem, so when I called out to the employee, I handed it over to get it by hand. it was done. The selling point is that you can see the beer being poured automatically from the bottom of the cup, so as a customer you want to see it and buy expensive beer, so the employee feels regret that he could not see it automatically. I told the person, but Im sorry, I didnt check the operation, so I knew the problem and I might be a convinced criminal. Since the customer service is mechanized, it may not be possible to make flexible decisions about troubles. It was a weird bar and weird employees.",3
It was a very interesting hotel. It was like a cottage. It was the innermost room in Building G. It was nice that the room was large and quiet at night near the strange hotel gate. Breakfast was convenient because the aura came out soon (* ^^ *),4
"It was a very nice environment and room, basically I was very satisfied! Its a 5-minute drive from my house, so Ive never stayed there before, but due to various reasons, I stayed. As a result, it was a place that I would like to stay again even if it is nearby. The only thing that bothered me was that the wallpaper in the room was peeling off. The inside of the kettle was wet and water was dripping, and it lacked cleanliness. Small garbage and hair were scattered all over the room. Great staff? men in a meeting? meeting? I was doing something like that in a place where customers passed by, and while I was waiting for the reception desk, I heard a story that I didnt have to ask, and somehow the fun feeling was pulled back to reality, and I felt depressed. is. I thought it was a waste because it was a wonderful room.",4
It was an interesting hotel.,3
It was beautiful,4
"It was beautiful inside I feel like I havent cleaned every corner There were no cotton swabs or towels, so I thought I would never use them again. It was written that the parking lot was free, but it was quite far away. I thought Toyoko Inn in front of Sasebo station would be good.",1
"it was better than i expected Only the minimum necessary amenities are provided in the room. The shop is only a vending machine. Since it is a product with the name of the hotel, it is also good as a souvenir! It was difficult to interact with the assistant robot in the room, but it was fun. The breakfast was delicious with more variety than I expected. The atmosphere was calm and the parents and children seemed to be comfortable.",4
It was clean near the Huis ten bosch.,3
"It was confusing and there was no restaurant at the hotel, so the dinner was only a cup of noodles and it was a restaurant only for morning, so I was tired of the price of rice, I didnt have tea, mineral Water is not put up ... It may be good if it is a hotel only to sleep Ne ~",3
"It was difficult to check in because there were many Chinese people at the reception to take pictures. Even during my check-in procedure, Im worried that my name, etc. will be in someone elses photo because they will try to take a picture from behind. It was far from the station, and there were no tricks than I expected, so I was disappointed. However, breakfast and dinner at the health food restaurant on the hotel premises were very delicious.",2
It was fun but a little inconvenient.,3
It was fun☺,5
"It was good to have a free hot spring ticket and Ise tea service. The room is new and clean. I thought I wouldnt wear it in the room, but I was saved because it was in the room. Perhaps because it was vacant, I didnt mind the noise around me. Its a pity that you cant leave your luggage for free before and after check-in, but if you pay 500 yen, it seems that the robot will take care of it. Extrasensory karaoke is 300 yen per song. I go inside and sing, but I dont recommend it because its normal.",4
It was good! I would like to come again!,5
"It was hard to understand the front desk, but it was quite interesting. The store was also an unmanned system, but there werent many products there, so it was troublesome to go in and out. It is best to buy food and drinks in advance. Word of mouth said that the room was small, but our room was very new and spacious even with two children. Above all, it is attractive that the toilet and bath are separate. It is minus that door of room faces inward.",4
"It was interesting because there was a robot luggage custody and it was rare. There was also an ordinary coin locker. Robot performances are fun in the lobby, and WAON can be used at vending machines. Hotel original cocktails are recommended at the bar. Its a little far from the park, but when you get tired, you can move by cart for 300 yen. You can stay much cheaper than other official hotels.",4
It was interesting that the robot was an employee.,5
"It was introduced on TV, so I stayed there just out of curiosity when I traveled to Kyushu. It was futuristic, or rather, it felt very strange. w",5
It was like a business hotel.,3
It was nice and quiet.,4
It was nice to be different from other hotels☆,4
"It was nice, simple and clean!",4
It was not smart to unmanner stalls and weird bars. The accommodation is clean and nice but the payment is stressful. It is talkative.,3
It was not unusual feeling except the front part. The room was large and clean.,4
It was ok 👍,3
It was only rain,5
"It was quiet and good. But when the restaurant is far away, I think that Tully says It did not happen.",3
It was quiet at night even though many students on school trips stayed there!,4
"It was really weird. It was a comfortable stay without any problems. It was convenient to unlock the room with face recognition, but Im a little worried. In addition, free smartphone rental was standard equipment.",5
"It was so beautiful that it was just made! It seemed that the hotel side took care to make it a different building, probably because I was suffering from a school trip student in terms of timing. Thanks to you, I slept quietly! Please note that there is a little distance when walking from Huis Ten Bosch.",4
It was strange,4
It was the front as I saw it on TV! But it would be better if I went there once.,3
"It was the second stay. From Huis Ten Bosch, I walked around the outside. That is faster than passing through. It is interesting because it is a robot reception, but sometimes it does not work, so it is painful in such cases. There is a staff button, but since the staff has come out lazy, that is minus one. Food has vending machines. It is cash. Drinks, convenience stores, card payment only",4
It was very beautiful and comfortable. The hotel in this area has a parking lot exclusively for accommodation at the entrance of Huis Ten Bosch. The parking lot in front of the hotel is charged for some reason. The guest felt inconvenienced when he walked or traveled by several buses for an hour.,3
It was very beautiful and the mechanism was easy to understand.,5
It wasnt that weird.,4
"It will be the first strange hotel that has now expanded to Tokyo. It is adjacent to Huis Ten Bosch, and I feel that there are many people who use it. In addition, the area around Huis Ten Bosch is a zone where you can enjoy it for free, and there is a parking lot, so I think it is easy to use. We also used the parking lot to use the restaurant next door. The interior of the hotel is very well cleaned and has a bright atmosphere. I just live in Sasebo, so I dont think I have a chance to use it. For those who like robots, I think its a very fun hotel. I think Huis Ten Bosch puts effort into making the facilities and events fun.",3
"It will be used for the second time. Simple, functional.",4
"It’s not convenient to check in at 15:30 pm, but the room is great.",5
Its a bit far from Huis Ten Bosch.,3
Its a futuristic hotel with a robot reception and no humans. The room was like a two-story cottage. It was a system where you can order and pay on the PC at the seat without anyone by cash or card payment.,3
"Its a new idea and a unique experience. All equipment in perfect working condition. I especially liked the bath tub. To the hotels credit, the shuttle arrived relatively quickly. I found the entire hotel to be very clean. There was a nice big breakfast buffet in the adjoining restaurant. The rooms are fine.",5
Its a new sensation 🏨 and fresh. The room was also very clean and nice.,5
Its a series of surprises and full of fun. The room is large and very clean and comfortable. The bathtub and washing area are separate so you can take a relaxing bath.,4
"Its a strange hotel, but there were many problems with the beer in the drink bar, please",4
"Its an interesting hotel using face recognition key and a robot guide, Chu-ri in each room. Unfortunately the face recognition system does not always recognized the faces, and Chu-ri was just annoying than helpful in most cases. You need to learn to turn off the light with the remote controller; there is no switch on a wall.",3
"Its beautiful, comfortable, and relaxing. There is no large public bath because there is a bath in the room. It is an image like a slightly rich business hotel. There is an unmanned convenience store on site. This is the songwriter. The convenience store itself has a face-recognition-type automatic lock, and it seems that one person in the group can shop inside the store, but at that time it was a gathering place for a group of people who didnt understand anything. Originally, when one person finished shopping and came out, the next person entered, so if a group occupied it, it would be difficult to come out. I paid by credit card, but it seemed that I could not do it, and it was just a chatting place for those inside. It seems that you are thinking of leaving everything to the machine,",3
"Its cheap and I think its okay to stay once, but other than the front desk, its about a business hotel, so I cant stay anymore. Since the HDD data disappeared, Im thinking of staying just to take pictures, but I think Ill probably stay at one of the official ones. For the time being, is the reception at the front desk the peak of this hotel? The dinosaur robot on the far left has an aerial display, but cash payment is not possible here. . There are also 5 weird games such as VR karaoke. There are also facilities such as an unmanned convenience store and a strange bar. I dont use a robot cloakroom, I ship my luggage from home and leave it at Yamato and go to the park. When its time to check in, take your luggage to the reception room. If you pay the cloakroom fee, its easier to go to Huis Ten Bosch empty-handed. postscript One dinosaur robot is gone.",2
Its cheap and very nice.,5
"Its clean and the price is reasonable! There are employees, so you can stay with peace of mind. There are plenty of amenities, so its suitable for family trips!",5
Its clean and you can go directly from Huis Ten Bosch so good! We can go to attraction area immediately!,5
"Its easy to re-enter and exit, and there are buses, so it wasnt a problem even with luggage! The bath in the room was made like a bath at home, so it was perfect for traveling with a small child! !",4
Its fun to try and stay at least once.,4
Its hard because there are no people when Im really in trouble 😅,2
Its hard to catch a taxi from the hotel...sweat Extension 9 is the only way to speak to the hotel staff.,4
"Its hard to understand if youre not used to it, but once you get used to it, its a fun hotel😆🎵🎵",4
"Its like a business hotel. The inside of the restaurant is narrow, so you have to wait in line outside to eat breakfast. Prioritize the function of the hotel, not the customer. Room without meals.",1
"Its nice to have the latest technology, but there were many problems and inconveniences. Also, since the room was a cottage type, I had to go out of the lobby once to go to the room, and I had to go to pick it up myself, so it was quite troublesome.",2
"Its nice to stay so playful that it doesnt end. However, because it is divided into several buildings, moving felt a little troublesome. I think that the concept of the hotel will match if there is a mechanical means of transportation other than walking.",4
"Its not as powerful as imagined, it just looks more novel",4
"Its pretty and its talkative, but I still fell in love with people.",3
"Its really cheap if you stay with H.I.S.s cheap plan Just because its cheap, the grade is on par with a B-class business hotel There is a charge for bed making, and one bed costs ¥1,000. It says that towels will be changed and cleaned, but the bath and toilet were dirty. The light was operated by remote control, but when I returned the next day, the remote control was gone.",2
"Its still new and clean, but if you take the wrong route, there are many stairs and its difficult if you have a lot of children or luggage. There is no guide around that area, so I think its a disadvantage of an unmanned hotel. The breakfast was delicious, but because there were students on a school trip, the best time was crowded and difficult to use, and it was hard to move to a different time than usual with small children. The Japanese-style room was clean and the bath was spacious, but there are steps, so Im worried about small children. However, the price is cheaper than other hotels, and it was nice to be able to access the garden directly from the garden!",3
"Its very convenient. You can walk directly into Huis Ten Bosch. When you walk back at night, there is a small section that is relatively dark. Afterwards, there is a large lighting area that looks very beautiful. The restaurant is clean, the robot counter is very interesting, the children are very happy, and the breakfast is healthy. It’s delicious. The food from the vending machines in the park is delicious. You can eat it when you’re hungry when you go back to the hotel at night. The only inconvenience is that the free parking lot is not next to the hotel, and you need to walk for a while. It’s very inconvenient for people with luggage and children. As foreigners, we dont know where the free parking lot is, so we parked in the paid parking lot next to the hotel that day.",5
"Ive been here more than 10 times and its still fun. As the slogan says, a hotel that keeps changing, so every time I come, something is increasing. No matter how many times you go, you will never get bored. I think its wonderful.",5
"Ive never heard the voices around me, so its a quiet image. The interior is simple and nice. Last year, there was Chuli in the middle and the lights were turned off, but this year there was no robot. Its a pity❗",4
"Laundry was missing, housekeeping in the room also left something to be desired !!! Full breakfast we had to wait !! Normal rest! I found the lighting in the room dim !!!!",3
"Located about a 5-minute walk from Huis Ten Bosch, it is extremely convenient, but I thought it was expensive for a simple room. Well, its cheaper than other official hotels, but I dont think its worth it to go just for the robot.",3
"Located near Huis Ten Bosch, there is a free parking lot exclusively for guests. There is also a shuttle bus from there, but it takes about 7 minutes on foot. Dinosaurs and android robots will accept it, but human staff are also resident, so if you have any questions, they will respond. You can enter the guest room with a card key and a face recognition system, rumba and an automatic lawn mower work, and the building is fashionable as a designer property. The dining room was clean and delicious.",5
"Location is the best, but it was fun to try variously without relying on people",4
"Lots of robots, but restaurant space is a bit small",4
"Many breakfast buffets are good! Bed, pillow very comfortable!",4
"Many new items, young people have fun, do not meet staff from check-in to check-out, staff service good when eating.",3
"Many robots can be enjoyed, but I thought convenience stores were inconvenient for card payments only. In the karaoke box, even though the voices were leaking outside, everyone was singing loudly without noticing. The breakfast had a lot of variety and was delicious. Difficult to find parking lot. I stopped at Times 24 at the hotel front desk, and an extra charge was taken.",4
More feeling on the high techinolgy of service.,4
My grandson was curious about the automatic lawn mower.,4
"My husband has a walking problem and I happened to be able to make a reservation for an electric cart that only had one Huis Ten Bosch. Can I make a reservation for disabled parking? I asked in advance. He told me that the hotel would prepare a wheelchair in the park so that it could be used at the hotel and secure a parking space for the disabled. On the day, there was a need, and my husband only checked in and had to go to the hotel from the park with an electric cart. I was worried because there were many hills and tried to call, I got to the hotel without problems. Surprisingly, you can move around the hotel while riding the electric cart! ! In the room closest to the lobby, it was very helpful. I was able to rest comfortably and slowly in the room. We were more comfortable than the hotel Europe. However, moving from the hotel to the park is OK with an electric cart, but it is not recommended for wheelchairs because there is a steep slope near the entrance of the park. It costs 300 yen per person because a cart taxi enters the hotel, but it feels special because it passes through places where people can not walk.",5

Never been,1
"Never go to Huis Ten Bosch. I have taken more than 400 overseas business trips for work. I made a reservation because it looked interesting. 10/21 Moved from Shin-Kobe. Due to the earthquake, the Shinkansen was delayed and we arrived at Hakata around 6:30. There are no direct trains at this hour. I took a detour on another route and arrived at 20:20. The hotel restaurant is closed at this time, and you cant even get a decent meal. 27,000 yen per night I had no choice but to buy a lunch box at a convenience store and headed to the hotel. The shuttle bus ends at 19:00. Its raining outside. Normally, I thought that there would be traffic in the hall during the time when the train was moving, but it was naive. If you follow the signs, you cant see anything that looks like a hotel, so call the front desk. I proceeded as instructed, but there is no hotel. I proceeded in the direction indicated by the arrow, but the display disappeared on the way. Even if you look at the whole map, there is no display of the hotel. Its raining outside. Luggage in both hands. I was able to check in at 9:30pm. I dont know what to evaluate. I would like to cancel and get another hotel and get a refund, but I cant do that because I have a companion.",1
"Never meet an employee at check-in or check-out. I feel very uncomfortable... But the room is comfortable and adequate. I just have a feeling that cospa is not good. The scenery of Huis Ten Bosch was very beautiful. Also, there is no elevator because it is a two story building. Its easy to come and go from room to room. The iris recognition of the eyes is also amazing, there is no need to carry a card. For access to the essential Huis Ten Bosch, you can walk to the back of the hotel and enter the adventure park in 1 minute. It was instant if we took patrol bus between hotel guest parking lot and hotel. I am very satisfied overall.",5
New hotel with tech. Nice place to try service without human.,4
New hotel. The convenience store in the hotel is only for credit cards. Room is normal.,5
"Nice hotel But mostly you have to check in/out , carry things by yourself",4
Nice place but technology needs improvement,3
"No good points. I thought it was a little strange and interesting, but the service is bad and its annoying",1
not good.,1
"Novel and novel hotel, check in self-service interaction with robots, comfortable living and eating, easy to enter the park, great accommodation experience",5
"Novelty, simplicity, comfort, technology.",5
Official hotel in Huis Ten Bosch. I was thrilled at the hotel!!,5
"Only lobby is impressive, room is small and far from lobby. The “far” means get out and walk long distance without roof. And unlucky me came on a heavy raining day! Can you imagine holding a umbrella and pull the case to find out the umbrella stand is inside the room????? Well now the floor in the room got wet by the umbrella, and the hand wash place is far from the toilet too!!!! With such no view garden I’d really appreciate if they could have made the room bigger! BTW, the parking lot is not free.",1
"Only used the lunch buffet. The menu had just the right variety for me and was very tasty. Also, I would like to use it when I come to Huis Ten Bosch.",3
"Overall it was clean, high tech and very good. However, I feel that it takes time because I have to call when something happens.",4
"Paid parking is available in front of the hotel. There is a pick-up car from the Huis Ten Bosch parking lot. Check-in with a touch panel floating in the air, a receipt with a room number and a card key will come out. It was a box type room, and the room was comfortable.",3
"Parking lots nearby are expensive! It was 1650 yen for 24 hours, about 300 yen for 1 hour at the time of posting. If you think about the cost, the truth is that you dont want to leave the garage if you stop. Well, its fine, but if its this expensive, I want you to write it big. It gets in the way of a pleasant trip.",2
"Personally, because I like these new things, I had a good time. I was able to experience a new trial (weird bar and 3D touch panel) and I enjoyed it.",4
"point of dissatisfaction ① The parking lot also takes money from the guests, and it is quite expensive at 1650 yen. Rip off. There is a free parking lot, but its a bit far, and there seems to be a bus from there, but the number is limited and it doesnt leave when I return from the trip. Its the first time Ive suddenly felt depressed at a hotel that heals the fatigue of my trip. ②You have to go outside to go from the front desk to your room. Its winter, so its cold, and if its raining, its even worse. (3) The hotel itself has no particular changes other than those advertised in advertisements. ④ I dont know if its Huis Ten Bosch cooperation, but various price ranges are expensive, and even a little amenities cost money. It was a provocative hotel. There is no repeat, and I do not recommend it. Its not worth coming just to see it in a video or something and think its amazing.",1
pretty,4
"Pros: Fast check-in and check-out, modern face recognition for room keys. Bad points: The room is too small w, various inconveniences. It feels like a simple hotel just to sleep, there will be no second time.",2
Proximity to theme parks with shortcuts in and out of parks,4
Qiuli sauce is super cute,4
Quite cool but not as amazing as expected. The rooms are really just normal rooms (although tuli chan is very cool). Perfect if youre going to the Dutch theme park as there is direct access from the hotel.,4
Reasonable hotel. breakfast was good,4
"Recommended if you go to Huis Ten Bosch. If you expect everything to be a state-of-the-art robot hotel, you might be disappointed. If you have children, I think you can enjoy it a little, but its not that much amusement, so if you cant stay cheaper than other nearby hotels, or if you didnt want to stay at least once, I wouldnt recommend it.",3
"Relatively cheap option, slightly poor soundproofing, great breakfast.",4
Robohon Orchestra How nice,5
Robot check in and out,5
"Robot check in works after the reservation was changed to how my passport displays my name (incorrect order). The room was comfortable. Chu-ri robot in room was not very responsive when talked to in English, and entered quiet mode by itself mid sentence. Our own siri and Google was more helpful. The novelty is the selling point.",3
"Robot Cloaks and Porter Robots are not moving, and the robots voice recognition in the lobby is useless, and the rooms mobile robot is free to talk out freely and it was totally useless.",1
"Robot counter service ~ very special, but only book room card and check-out card ~ there is a lot of room for improvement",3
robot hotel. want to go.,3
robot is amazing,4
"Robot reception is unique. It is a clean facility. During the busy season, if you dont book early, you wont be able to get it. Breakfast restaurant was very good. A little walk from Huis Ten Bosch.",4
"Robot theme hotel, good! The robot tulip doll in the room is cute but dumb! Although the room has a second floor, there are elevators and sloped walkways to facilitate pushing suitcases. The only downside is that there is no convenience store nearby. If you want to eat in a restaurant or in the fort, the nearest convenience store is at JR Hotel. There is a shuttle bus from the hotel to the entrance of the fort, and it takes about 15 minutes to walk to the entrance of the fort",4
Robots ... people ... all in half and can not cope with anything ... sorry,1
"Robots are not high-performance, but if you touch them loosely, its pretty interesting.",4
Robots as staff excellent,5
Robots malfunction,1
Rooms are usually clean and in some places I can see a little in the park. There are vending machines nearby and from the park It is near or in a convenient place. A hotel with a clean atmosphere and breakfast venue The reception is also interesting A calm atmosphere no matter where the room is,5

satisfaction,5
"Shantou ~ room is too small, the robot inside the house often fails, and often answer questions, the door lock identification system often inexplicable fault ~",3
"Since it is unattended, it can be used comfortably without having to be weird.",5
Smart convenience store and zone are good,5
"Sound leakage is too severe. Footsteps until midnight? You will continue to hear a sound like. I thought it was a child in the room directly above, but looking at the reviews of other people, it seems that the sound of all the rooms on the upper floor is leaking out of the cylinder. I made a phone call to the front desk unbearably, but I finally got connected after calling 4 times, and the telephone response was less than a part-time job and attitude. There were many other dissatisfactions, but I was decisively angry with this sound problem, so I wrote it. Is the person who writes a good review the one who stayed on the second floor? I think. We will never use it again, and we recommend staying at another place even if it is a little expensive. It was a really strange hotel. I want you to return the money.",1
Stayed because my nephew insisted,5
"Stayed here again yesterday. I used it on a group trip this time. The room type is a deluxe Japanese-style room on the first floor. We stayed with 4 adults, but the size was just right. good point ・Clean and spacious ・There is luggage space ・ The bath is large enough for two adults to enter together ・Is the water quality of the bath water good? (soft) ・Domtorn and Ferris wheel can be seen from the balcony of the room ・Close to Henn na Hotel entrance and breakfast venue ・ Still cheap ・ The staff at the breakfast venue are very kind and polite bad point ・The sound of footsteps on the upper floor is quite noisy. ・Part of the breakfast menu is not delicious ・Because it is cheap, there are quite a lot of families and foreign customers. ・Its a type where you take off your shoes, but its inconvenient because there are no slippers when you go out for a while. ・Times in front of the hotel is expensive at 330 yen per hour. A friend couple and my husband who stayed for the first time seemed to be satisfied. Im sensitive to sound, so I was a little stressed by the footsteps on the upper floor, the loud voices of foreigners, and the loud voices of families. Other than that, I am generally satisfied. I stayed in two types of rooms last time and this time, but I have the impression that each room is hit or miss.",4
"Stayed in a Japanese-style deluxe room. I was surprised and excited by the reception when I entered. I waited about 10 to 15 minutes because of a system error, probably because it was the first time in a while since the end of self-restraint, and it was time for dinner. The room is very clean! There was too much area, and cleaning was perfect. However, there are few amenities, and there are no sponges to wash the body or simple slippers. I thought that if I could tell the receptionist, I could buy it at a smart convenience store and go to the room. Its a pity if it rains because you have to walk outside from the reception to the room. But the scenery was beautiful and I had fun along the way! Breakfast is very delicious at the natural food restaurant and the volume is perfect! The staff was also kind (^-^) I enjoyed my first family trip!",4
"Stayed in August 2020. This is an inconvenience. It gets wet when its raining. It is difficult to walk with an umbrella with a large baggage and avoid a puddle. Especially if you have children. There was only one coin laundry in one place, so it was difficult to use. A fairly expensive setting. Moreover, there is no money changer and the vending machine happens to run out of money. In the rain at night, it was stressful to go to the front ridge on a pitch-black road with few lights. Even though its a new building, I can hear the footsteps of the other floors. Its a good impression to have separate bath and toilet. However, since it is a sensor light all over the room, it disappears even when you do not want it to disappear, which is frustrating. For breakfast, measures have been taken due to the influence of corona, and the employee puts what the customer has selected on the tray. However, the number of employees was too large and crowded. Others commented, but the free parking lot was far away and it was raining so I stopped it nearby but it was 1650 yen. I dont want to recommend it to anyone because it is too inconvenient.",1
"Stayed on 2/11/2019 The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. I was with my children, so they were very happy. I was a little worried that the footsteps of a cheerful child echoed in the space under the floor, and I was a little worried that I might be annoyed by the surrounding guests, but I think this is a problem of discipline. The bath is a unit bath, and the size is 1616 or 1414? I think its a clean choice. The toilet was separate and had a shower toilet (Panas Arauno). The toilet is large enough to accompany a childs toilet. The network is fairly fast and downloading videos is a breeze. The outlet in the room was USB compatible, so no charger was needed. I felt that this area was very advanced. I think that travelers from overseas will be very helpful. Amenities must be purchased from the vending machine at the front desk. Note that there is no toothbrush! There is a strange bar and convenience store in the front building, but there was nothing to see other than the curiosity. Since this is a hotel with a new concept, if we can work a little harder to narrow down our ideas, the number of guests who want to stay at this hotel may increase. Robbies robot performance also lacks novelty. As it is now, I have the impression that the product power is half-hearted. Since it was a plan without breakfast, I was looking forward to going to eat Sasebo burger in the morning, but my child got hungry, so I decided to eat at the hotel. In that case, the cost is 2200 yen / adult It was a pretty bullish pricing. The content was a buffet, but the number of items is small. I took a picture when I left, so Ill upload it.",3
"Stayed one night with a national travel assistance. I didnt know what to do with my vaccination certificate and ID card when checking in, and if I played Dinosaur many times, I would make a series of errors... The procedure related to the support split was a manned response at a place away from check-in. So it was a vaccination certificate, filling out a discount application, and issuing a regional coupon. After that, it was the check-in procedure and the issuance of the card key. There is no particular explanation of the facility, I checked the instructions on the envelope myself. The room was clean. There is no drink or water in the refrigerator, so I think you should bring it in. Also, the number of parking lots is limited, so I think its good to secure a spot early. In addition, it is hotel where we want to stay at.",4
"Strange hotel I was surprised I thought it was a dormitory for people working at the construction site Shoboi Weekly Mansion Wards of psychotic patients For the first time, I stayed in a toilet paper room that was decreasing after someone used it There is no elevator There is no porter who will carry the luggage Parking lot is Times 24 If it is called Japans first robot hotel I wondered if there were enough robots to carry my luggage Just buy a ticket on the touch panel like an unmanned ticket machine at the station No robots It is too far from the guest parking lot of Huis Ten Bosch It is impossible for people with luggage Perhaps just built near Huis Ten Bosch I usually think that it is a dormitory use of students and uncles at the construction site There is no cheaper construction than this TV is not in front of the bed It is attached to the side wall on the toilet side Its a rare 14 inch or 17 inch small TV nowadays Probably a wiring relationship How do you look sideways? I do not think about the customer at all The lowest ranked room without love, which has achieved thorough cost savings excluding all services It is better to remember who is the owner who does this kind of work People without love have no love whatever they do There is a translation and I will be staying at such a place, I will never stay again in my life If it is Nagasaki, the rent will be 20,000 yen or 30,000 yen a month if it is this size 40,000 yen will not do A place like 1000 yen a day There is a certain extent to making a fool of the customer I felt very sorry and lonely Although I love Nagasaki, I want you to get out of Nagasaki",1
"strange? A rather interesting hotel. There is no conversation, so its lacking in the fun of the trip (lol) The building is beautiful and stylish! However, since it is prefabricated, there is a building that shakes when jumping in the room.",3
subtle,2
"Super interesting robot restaurant, robot service is very novel very special hotel Those who like early adopters can try it",5
Surprisingly normal,3
"Terrible service, the front desk robots were not working and the staff did not do much to alleviate the swarm of tourist coming in from the cold to check in. Staff had a poor command of english for an attraction that boasts about their european themes and was unable to help tourists who could only speak english. Wifi in the room was not working at all. Passport scanner at the check-in counter was down, leaving overseas tourists who need to scan their passports stuck. The holographic menu of one of the check-in counters is wonky at best, doesnt detect inputs on its “buttons” properly and was a little cut off on the left side. Staff showed very little empathy in helping the check-in process while the lobby was getting overwhelmed with more tourist coming in. Entire check-in process took more than an hour. Not recommended and as other reviewers have noted, the robots are just gimmicky.",1
"That was weird. It is a new and clean hotel. From naming, there were many children. The proof of the room was perceptive and felt nervous to me. Did you turn off the sensor with the remote control? It is unknown whether it is the sound of childrens footsteps or the sound of rumba in the corridor, but there was a buzzing noise in the middle of the night. The buffet breakfast was also delicious. The front desk and the stand are unmanned! high tech! ! Please stay by all means.",4
"The accommodation was good, but when I asked for tourist information, it was good that they were kind, but I was in trouble because I couldnt catch a taxi for a while in the heat because it was a completely different place from my purpose.",3
The AI robots always spook me in a confusing way. Nice ambience.,5
The area is so large that you cant finish playing in one day,5
"The bath was very clean and spacious, which was very good for me who wanted to enter in a private room! I knew in advance that there werent enough amenities, but there really wasnt anything! Lol Also, I was very worried about check-in. Characters floating in the air, not a touch panel? I press, but I couldnt press it easily and it seemed that I couldnt make it in time for the meeting time. I wonder if its okay ... After that, I was really in trouble and pressed the call, but no one came at all w",2
The buffet has a wide variety of items and is easy to take,5
"The building and rooms were nice, and the breakfast was delicious. Robots are fun too. It was good to think that customer service is good again.",5
"The check-in system is fast and easy. However, the jumble of spectators makes it look horribly crowded. There was one front desk staff member, but quite a few people were hanging out near the front desk, so I couldnt keep up with the collection.",2
"The children looked happy, but the convenience store didnt work well for face recognition, and eventually they got the key open. I can not read the item. I do not open the key after shopping. Chu-chan also responds badly. There are too few guidance than anything. If the hotel staff is smaller than usual, it should be easier to understand than a regular hotel. I do not know which entrance to the Early Park Inn, and there was a signboard when the rental cycle is discounted, but I do not know how to discount it. Need improvement.",3
"The children were frightened by the robotic dinosaur at the reception, but they wanted to see it.",4
"The concept of design and robot service is interesting, and the entrance for guests to Huis Ten Bosch is convenient, but there were many system glitches, and both dinosaur check-in and face recognition as a room key could not be used. I wanted to stay for a long time because it is a high-tech hotel, but in the end it was disappointing to check in like a normal hotel. Also, the parking lot is inconvenient, the footsteps in the hallway are very noisy, I couldnt stay comfortably, and the price wasnt cheap, so I probably wont use this hotel for a while until it improves. I wouldnt recommend it.",2
"The dinosaur at the reception was exactly what you saw in the media. Is it a normal hotel? I thought. You can enter Huis Ten Bosch 15 minutes before opening, or you can rent a bicycle at a reasonable price. Next time, I would like to stay overnight and take a break on the way to enjoy Huis Ten Bosch. The negatives are that the lighting in the room was difficult to handle, and the face authentication registration was a little troublesome (although there was a normal card key). The new system will be difficult, but I hope you will continue to do your best as a hotel that surprises you. I still want to use it.",4
"The ends of my hair and tissues were falling off, and at first I thought, Is that why its weird? You must be negligent... I like dinosaurs so the reception was fun",1
"The entrance of Huis Ten Bosch is close, so you can play until the closing time. I liked the scent of the wood. Breakfast is also delicious.",5
"The environment is clean, the bed is very comfortable, the breakfast is naturally nutritious and delicious, 5 minutes away from the round area",5
"The environment is very clean and I like it, and the breakfast is delicious",5
"The fact that the number of staff members can be reduced by robotization has been a topic for some time now. I stayed for the first time, but honestly I expected something more smooth. I think that the robot and the operation feeling at the time of check-in, and the concierge by the tablet and AI in the room can further improve in terms of UI and usability. There is not a lot of dissatisfaction in the room itself, so if you want to sell robots, you want to find something more obvious.",3
"The feature is the robot, the most useless is also the robot",3
"The front desk was very accomodating. The face recognition for unlocking your room was the coolest. Very well trained personnel, in my opinion. We had a very large suite. The rooms are kept very clean. The best feature is the convenience. Have all the facilities you can expect for such a hotel.",5
"The front desk, the robot corresponds perfectly However, I do not know whether the robot was cleaning in the room, but it was disappointing that the fly was dead on the floor (^ _ ^;)))",3
The front robot has no role! Morning buffet was good.,3
"The good point is that the concept is novel and there is no fun in other hotels. The place where breakfast is so delicious. Bad places are hard to understand and unkind. When there is any trouble, I still suffer when there is no human staff. When I finally thought I could call the staff, I was not apologetic. In addition, if I was going to deposit my luggage, I was asked to deposit it at the coin locker before check-in and it took 700 yen. I was really unkind and surprised. Also, when I was lying on the bed in the room, the sound of walking in the room rang. The hotel itself is clean and clean, and it is good in nature, but it is not good as an overall impression. Many times I was uncomfortable. I will never repeat this hotel again. It will be another if it improves it.",2
"The good thing is that the breakfast buffet is delicious. The rooms are also beautiful. But the staff is not good. I sell unmanned people, but I have to stay at the hotel for work, so I cant check in unless I have staff support, but I want you to think a little more and figure out who is going to stay. after. Even in the building on the second floor, there is no elevator, so the suitcase is heavy and it is very difficult. So honestly I dont want to stay here.",1
"The guidance of the robot is interesting. However, the hotel staff who were in the backyard were looking for embarrassingly taking off boarding time and were looking for the final stage 77 of the naval school needlepoint branch school or 76 or seven cherry tree trees after seventeen I was relieved to thank you for guiding me to the planted monument. The staff of the Nikko hotel next to it does not know. The stillness of the surface of the sea of ​​Hatsuo Bay is still remembered. Also, I saw the surface of the morning sun Hui Bay.",5
"The hot water in the bathroom doesnt get warm. You can only shop at convenience stores in the hotel with your smartphone or card. I felt that all the guests were not conscious of it, focusing only on being an advanced hotel.",1
"The hotel and rooms were clean and nice. The robot service was new and the children were delighted. There was a foot massager rental service, but it seems that some people couldnt use it because there werent many. I felt that it was a hotel where you can get enough cost performance if you dont want much.",4
"The hotel here looks very beautiful. Just a wall or ceiling? The floor on the second floor is thin and the footprints can be heard normally. I can hear the voice of my neighbor so much that I can talk with him. Its worse than Les ○ Palace. People who want to relax at the hotel should stop. I tried to call the front desk, but I didnt put it down. He was a polite employee when he told the contents from his mobile phone. From the contents, the accommodation cost is high, is it a strange hotel made cheaply anyway? What does a strange hotel mean? Is that all right? Check out at Frustrated MAX.",1
The hotel I stayed on the 15th and 16th,3
"The hotel is great but the breakfast is quite crowded depending on the time of day and there is a wait. Furthermore, the staff came when I finally ate, and I immediately cleaned up the empty dishes and I did not feel like eating slowly.",4
"The hotel is new and clean, and the sound insulation is great!",5
"The hotel is new, but if you want to park your car for free, you have to go to the hotel in the Possenburg parking lot for 10 minutes, and the parking at the door is 300 円 1 hour!",3
"The hotel itself was very clean and responsive, but the family staying next door was so noisy that I couldnt sleep. From 21:00 to around midnight, I called the front desk with a slapstick and noisy voice, but it seemed that they responded, but it didnt change. Its the first time for me to have a thin wall, so Ill never stay there anymore. Breakfast is delicious, but the variety is less than normal even though it is a buffet. There are few and there is nothing specially delicious. In the bathtub of the room, my hair was stuck to the bathtub, and I wondered if I was cleaning it.",2
"The hotel of the rumor that the robot does the reception. It is good to stay at Huis Ten Bosch. Strollers that can be rented in the harbor zone in Huis Ten Bosch are taken out to strange hotels and can be returned as they are. However, it seems that you dont know the reception robot dinosaur to return it, and I asked for a human response. The accommodation wing is beautiful. Rooma cleans the aisle. The stroller could not go to the room because it was a ridge without a lift to the second floor.",3
"The hotels facilities are novel and technological, the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are large, and the beds are very good to sleep. You can park for free in the parking spaces of the designated Huis Ten Bosch residences (you can pass the card when you check out)",5
"The huge Tully robot in front of the entrance is interesting. At first, it is difficult to use this hotel, but it is fun if you can get used to it. It was nice to have an extraordinary feeling.",5
"The idea of ​​closing the reception is interesting, but it is difficult on rainy days because there is no roof until you reach the entrance on the second floor. Also, the hotel is small.",3
The idea of ​​robots doing all the hospitality is interesting. I think that it is fashionable to have a cottage style.,5
"The interesting facility itself was very beautiful. But Tuli-chan, who speaks at the bedside, answers me a bit loudly.",3
The interior is stylish and nice! Its nice because the breakfast place is nearby and its a buffet. I wonder if it took a while to check in. Its cheap and nice at a hotel in Huis Ten Bosch!,4
The interior was beautiful and the facilities were perfect!,5
The kingdom of light at night is beautiful,5
"The lobby was separated from the room, and it felt like an apartment. The quadruple room had a separate toilet and bath, which was great. The triple room has the same toilet and bath. The place to eat is also in a different building, so you will have to walk.",4
"The location is the best part of all. I go into the room, and it is standard nice new hotel room. The room itself was hotel standard clean. The services absolutely are the best in the region. Stars while it is new n hopefully they will make it more non.",5
The location of the hotel is difficult to understand The ridge of the room is divided into several places If you go to the front desk I have to go out once Is it the worst on a rainy day? Unmanned smart convenience stores Because it is only in the front inconvenience,2
The name was strange but it was a nice hotel with a calm atmosphere,3
"The noise of the next room is quite good, though it is new and beautiful. Its compatible with robots, but when you call the front desk, people get out and its a very polite response 😅 The breakfast buffet is full of staff and whatever you eat is delicious !! Moth Worth staying",4
"The parking lot in front of the hotel is charged. The hotels parking lot is near the entrance of Huis Ten Bosch and it seems to be a free bus or a walk from there. If you think about the flight, you will be parked in the front of the toll parking lot. The room is quite small, and the traveling line collides with the traveling companion.",2
"The parking lot next to the hotel is charged, but if you park at the visitor center (?) and use the tour bus, the parking ticket will be processed for free (self), so dont forget it.",4
"The parking lot on the premises is 1650 yen. If you park at the Huis Ten Bosch parking lot, the ticket is issued at the hotel and is free of charge. Or it is better to park at the Huis Ten Bosch free parking lot. There is a shuttle bus depending on the time. There is a free bath operated by Huis Ten Bosch. People come in from nearby hotels, so its crowded. There is no equipment such as makeup remover and milky lotion cosmetics, so there is a charge",3
"The person on the front desk is strange. I may have changed but, when considered in calm, all self-service",4
The point is a self-service hotel. The room is clean and comfortable.,4
The porter robot is interesting.,4
"The price was a little over 15,000 yen for two people, so I thought it was reasonable. The room was clean and spacious, so Im satisfied. Also, robots have been introduced, so I have less contact with people, which I think is a plus in this corona crisis. It is written that the price should be lower because other people will introduce robots and labor costs will be cheaper, but it seems that preparing that many robots is a considerable capital investment. , I thought it was a reasonable room rate. I will be using this again.",5
The reaction of the robot named Chuuri-chan is not good enough,4
The reception is in the lobby and the friendly and helpful service makes this hotel one of the best in the world. I slept there in June 2015. Four years ago everything was automatically 5 stars,5
"The reception of the robot was new, but still felt a little inconvenient. I think that it was interesting that the key of the door registers the eyes.",4
The receptionist robot broke down and the receptionist came out and there was no sense of a strange hotel,1
"The receptionists older sister robot was really real (laughs) Personally, its this time of the year (although the staff is in the back, of course), I thought it would be possible even if it wasnt interpersonal, and if you stay overnight, this spec is enough. The breakfast buffet was also delicious! It is also very good that you can soak in the bath instead of the unit bath ☆ Regarding the noise, I didnt mind at all because it was on the 2nd floor and I stayed on Thursday.",4
The recognition rate of voice recognition robots is low. The robot porter doesnt deliver packages to B building. There are no elevators or escalators in Building B. Not as automatic as I expected.,2
"The restaurant aura is closed for dinner, probably because of COVID19. It was a terrific dinner of vending machine snacks and drink dinner in the facility. By the way, the kanji name of the person who made the reservation is also wrong, and there is no next! !!",1
"The restaurant is very simple, the space is small, the breakfast is traditional Japanese, delicious",3
The restaurant next to Henn-na Hotel is a buffet-style restaurant. It was a healthy and delicious place with vegetables grown in the restaurant and millet rice.,4
"The robot counter is special but it will be a little less warm The hotel looks like a container house The interior of the room is not big, the style is simple and comfortable The dinner company is an all-you-can-eat About 1000 is not cheap The main dining bar is small not many dishes If you go by yourself, you probably wont choose him~ Breakfast is served at the same location Its not bad to make a sandwich yourself",4
The robot is difficult to understand the guidance,1
"The robot placed on the bedside was not working and was not helpful, but the location was good, clean and comfortable.",5
The robot was at the reception and it was interesting.,5
The robots are temporarily closed but humans are working 😄 and theyre kind.,4
"The room and bath are spacious and perfect, but the TV was small for the room",4
"The room and bathroom are spacious and beautiful. HTB can be easily entered on foot, which is convenient.",5
"The room can be recognized by the face, a nice place",4
The room door can be specially set for facial recognition. Simple breakfast.,4
"The room feels good and the robots are interesting. However, the employees response was disappointing. I felt sorry for the night of making memories. It may happen to happen, but I will not stay again.",2
"The room has a large bathroom and a separate toilet, which is easier to use than going to the hot springs by bus. Even though the room was spacious and fully occupied, I didnt notice any noise from other rooms. Clean. Breakfast was also prepared, including baby food, and I was satisfied enough.",4
"The room in Building F was very clean and smelled of wood. I want information. The operation of the air conditioner was difficult and there was no explanation, so I was embarrassed by the heat. It rained at breakfast time and the new building didnt have an umbrella. Waiting time was too long. Amenities were scarce, not even cotton swabs, no water service, no freezer space in the fridge. There was a vending machine. No range. One large and one small towel, more elaborate than going to a business hotel. It was just a tea pack, but the coffee cup smelled of coffee, and the cup was black, so I wondered if it had been washed. The bed didnt fit and my shoulders were stiff, so I went for a massage instead. There were 3 ways to access the front desk, but it may be inconvenient when you are in a hurry. It is smooth if you park in the parking lot and take the bus in the park to the hotel. For the first time this time, there is a gate on the shortcut down from the hotel, and you can purchase an admission ticket. At the front gate, tickets from 17:00 are not sold until 16:30, and there is no information. They didnt give me a hot spring ticket. Why❔",3
"The room is a little small, but Wi-Fi is strong and very comfortable! The toilet and bath are in the same space.",5
"The room is clean and safe because it is a card key lock. However, note that the room number is not written on the card key.",5
The room is clean because it is new.,3
"The room is clean but feels small. The robot should have done it, but most of the people didnt do well and it took extra time.",2
"The room is clean, but its a hassle! For young people!",3
The room is clean.,4
"The room is clean. Excellent location. Convenience is high, such as free bathing tickets for Haustenbos Onsen, but it is difficult to cool the amount you bring in because the refrigerator is at the level of a cold storage. Please buy it in the hotel. Since the customer service at the front desk is at the part-time job level, only robot reception is recommended.",3
"The room is comfortable, the advanced face recognition enters the room, the room card can be taken without it!",4
The room is poorly cleaned and doesnt feel clean. The front staff is fine with less than a part-time job. The hotel fee is almost the location fee. I think that the cause of the long line at the automatic check-in machine is the incompetence of the human staff. I will never go again.,1
"The room is woody, calm and comfortable🌳 Only the public space is strange. I feel comfortable in the room. About 10 minutes to the park, there is an entrance limited to hotel guests, and the advantage of being an official hotel is that you can enter 15 minutes before the park opens🌟🌟🌟 I do not recommend AURAs breakfast buffet because it is not cost-effective. . .",4
"The room smelled musty and I couldnt sleep. There was mold in the bathroom as well. The dryer was broken and only cold air came out, and the dust was quite accumulated.",2
"The room was beautiful. Since there are few parking lots, it is recommended to secure it early. There are times parking and hotel parking. Breakfast is a buffet, and infectious disease control is perfect. There is no special menu, but I think you will be satisfied with the variety. Huis Ten Bosch is connected to a re-entry entrance and you can enjoy a restaurant for dinner, but it is very crowded everywhere, so it is recommended to choose an early shop. The reception is fully automatic, and I will talk a little about dinosaurs, but I can not do anything other than the operation, so dont expect too much.",4
The room was clean and comfortable as it is still over a year old. It was also interesting to meet the robot.,4
The room was clean and the breakfast was delicious! A lot of technology is very modern and amazing,5
"The room was clean. I dont know because I didnt have dinner, but there were healthy items for breakfast. However, it may be difficult to move from the front desk to the room and dining venue in rainy weather.",5
"The room was just what I needed, not too big, not too small, and it was a clean hotel. The parking lot was far away and the shuttle bus was already gone at night, so I walked a lot because I lost to rock-paper-scissors. (There is a paid P on the premises...)",3
"The room was small. The passage between the bed and the wall was less than a meter wide. There was a kettle, but you have to buy tea at an unmanned convenience store. Also, when I pulled the blinds down, the blinds were horribly dirty. At first, the toilet seat was a little dirty. It was a little disappointing.",3
The room was smaller than I thought but it smelled like wood and healed,3
"The rooms are clean and beautiful! The disappointing thing is the breakfast buffet menu, taste, and customer service. I just like the room! ? there is no next",2
"The smart device Churi-chan in the room is pretty stupid, but its pretty blurry and it makes me smile.",5
The smell in the hotel is so soothing!,5
"The sound insulation is very, very, very poor, you can hear everything you say, and you have the worst experience of running a marathon upstairs. The indoor steps are not friendly to children, and they are easy to collide and get injured. The counter robot is very special. Summary: No way to get a good nights rest.",1
"The thuri robot at that time was a reaction. Other than that, it is okay.",4
"The touch panel floating in China was not so responsive and frustrating, but the room was clean and comfortable. There was also a smartphone terminal, and the wi-fi environment was in place and it was comfortable.",4
The unmanned convenience store was interesting.,5
The wall keeps getting punched from the next room I was terrified.,1
"The worlds first robot hotel. Three robots imitating a woman and a dinosaur to pick up a guest at the front desk, communicate with the customer in a multilingual manner, and perform check-in and check-out procedures. With the latest face recognition, the facility allows guests to keyless stay without room keys. Can strange uncle also stay?",3
There are no alcoholic beverages in the vending machine,3
"There are no elevators to go to the second floor with heavy luggage and lots of luggage but its negative. It looks like a corporation. If it is a place only to go to bed and play until the end of the day at Huis Ten Bosch, so-so. The child seems to have enjoyed playing with Tuli-chan Robo.",4
"There are no people, so the trash on the floor is right there",2
There are various robots and it is fun.,5
There is a monster at the reception and its interesting! The breakfast was also delicious. It was convenient near Huis Ten Bosch.,4
"There is also a gate that allows you to enter and exit directly at the official hotel of Huis Ten Bosch. It is a pity that there is no late check-out with an annual passport. For breakfast, I wanted a more Nagasaki-like menu.",5
"There is android at the front desk, and check-in etc. are operated by yourself while looking at the screen. The convenience store in the hotel is also an unattended face recognition system that opens the door. There was also a manned counter, so there was no particular inconvenience. There was a smartphone that you could carry around in the room, and you could use the internet and make calls as much as you wanted.",3
"There is no elevator. Clean. It is easy to use because the water circulation is wide. There is a shortcut to Huis Ten Bosch. I re-entered to see the light up, but this was convenient. Shuttle bus transfer to the front of Huis Ten Bosch is available at check-in / out. Certainly, I thought that there was nothing wrong with the staff but the staff was minimal, but when I left something in the refrigerator after check-out, when I was able to consult with the cleaning staff, I wanted to appreciate it.",4
There is no need for excess service,5
"There is no problem in the room. Breakfast is satisfactory. It is not strange at all. When I was checking in, I was kept waiting for more than 30 minutes due to system trouble or something. It is not crowded. And although it is summer, the lobby is hot. worst. I thought that the robot would be a porter, but there is no such thing at all. The cost may be cheaper at Huis Ten Bosch but the quality of the staff is also lower.",2
"There is no receptionist, so everything is IT. Its a little hard to use.",2
"There is no roof from the front desk to the room! smile It may be a small thing, but the tension may go down except when the weather is fine.",3
"There is only a robot at the reception! After that, it feels like a slightly inconvenient business hotel I expected too much",1
There may be no novelty other than the receptionist being a robot. The room feels like a neat business hotel. The location is convenient near the adventure area of ​​Huis Ten Bosch.,3
"There may be some strange hotels, but the human staff seems to be unmotivated part-timers when it comes to customer service. There is a day-use hot spring (diapers and tattoos not allowed) a short distance away. Guests can get a free ticket if they ask a human staff, and they will pick you up by bus for free. Umbrellas are required on rainy days from the front desk to the room and from the room to the breakfast venue, but you can borrow them for free. To Huis Ten Bosch, it depends on the location of the room, but there is a plain mountain climbing and descending.",2
"There was a robot that recognizes words in the hotel room, and the children could spend time in the room without getting bored.",4
"There was no elevator, only stairs. It was hot in the summer because there was no air conditioning in the hallway. I cant keep my luggage before check-in, and the automatic storage in front of the front desk is too small to fit. It was nice to have a separate bath and toilet, but the amenities are poorer than business hotels. The breakfast buffet has the same menu for all three islands, and I was surprised by the small number of items. A normal undivided plate would be fine. Attitude of staff is not good enough, too. Dont stay at this hotel, just watch someone check in next to you. I will never stay there again.",1
"There was no such thing as a large public bath, but the bath in the room was very beautiful and wonderful among the baths in the hotel room that had stopped so far. It was like a bath in a fancy home. If you look at this hotel as a hotel, it may be said that there are few services and it is difficult to hear flexibility, but if you look at it as a strange hotel, there are many things that you cannot experience at a normal hotel, which is fun. If you want cost performance as a hotel, you should choose something else.",4
"There were many unusual things, and the hotel itself was like one attraction of Huis Ten Bosch.",5
This change is worth to experience!,5
This evaluation because it was a unit bus,3
This is a beautiful hotel. Sometimes there are human employees. I think the location is good because it is directly connected to Huis Ten Bosch!,5
"This is a rare hotel where a robot works at the front desk. Since the staff is usually stationed, we were able to respond to irregular things. The guest room turned around and I was able to relax slowly in a modern and contemporary simple room. I was a little worried about footsteps upstairs. The water pressure of the shower was perfect, and the bed was moderately soft and I was able to sleep well! It is a little far from the inside of Huis Ten Bosch, about 5 minutes on foot to the entrance of Adventure Park, and about 5 minutes on foot from there to Flower Road. Only hotel guests can enter the park 15 minutes before opening, so I was able to take pictures of the unmanned Flower Road for a short time. In addition, there are coupons for hotel guests only, and we were able to receive one free drink and discount services at the restaurants in the park. I think this hotel is a good option for those who want to enjoy Huis Ten Bosch mainly on the adventure park side. Above all, I think that the cost performance is outstanding among Huis Ten Bosch official hotels!",5
This is the worst hotel.,1
"Thorough. Cheap as an official hotel, its the result of thorough robotization and rationalization. Bring your own razor and toiletries.",4
"Touch the robot with a dinosaur and a female robot at the front, and enter characters! If you follow the guidance while puzzled, the card key comes out and check-in is complete! ! ... But I was expecting too much and since then I have not been so moved. It feels like its better to be a more weird hotel. The room is new and beautiful. It was like an ordinary business hotel.",3
Tully is delicate. I turned off the lights in the room.,4
Tullys response in the room is not good I might not like the conversation of response,4
Under construction 工事,1
Uninhabited hotel. Passport required at check-in. Room numbers are all that is required for breakfast. Check-in counter and room are separate. There is an unattended bar and only cards,3
unique and comfortable,5
"Unlike the information I got before my stay, the amenities were complete, clean and very comfortable. Check-in is very easy, just fill in your name and phone number. I would like to visit again.",5
"Until check-out, I did not see the staff except meals. It was very easy to get in and out of the room key after registering face authentication. We go outside to go to each building from the front desk, but we can use because umbrella of hotel is in umbrella stand of doorway in case of rain. It was interesting.",4
"Use it as a topic of conversation. It would be nice if the room rate was cheap, but if you pay the same amount, I would like to use another.",3
using a robot,4
"Very bad place, the hardware and equipment are not perfect, the price is nearly 10,000 yuan per night, and there is not even a bottle of water, tea bags and coffee bags. You have to buy it yourself. It is more practical to live in a nearby five-star hotel for the same price. A hotel not recommended",1
"very beautiful. Its very simple. Amenities include toothbrush, comb, razor, bottle rinse shampoo, bottle body shampoo only. Towel size. Adult room pajamas available. Necessary things are sold at a reasonable price at the vending machine next to the front desk. Breakfast is a buffet at the natural food restaurant and is delicious.",5
"Very clean and privacy is ensured. Breakfast was good too. The concept of having a robot serve customers is interesting, and its amazing that its actually happening. However, when I stayed there, there were few amenities, and I felt inconvenient, such as being inflexible even if I asked the front desk for a little help.",3
Very cute hotel,5
Very functional and groundbreaking hotel,5
"Very good experience for the kids everything use robots, our stay was happy just the room are too small",4.8
Very interesting hotel with all the robots,5
Very interesting hotel!!,5
very special,5
very special hotel,5
very special stay,5
"Visit the entrance. The front is usually only robots, but if you have a problem, you can call someone. The facility is new and very clean, and as of September 2018, it was undergoing expansion work.",3
Voice recognition accuracy of the robot is not good enough,2
was fun,4
was fun!,5
Was funny,4
Was funny!,5
Was interesting! There are various robots and they are cute! Check-in is also fun. Cheap hotel 🏨 to Huis Ten Bosch Lahen,5
Was it a beautiful hotel?,3
Was it a strange hotel?,3
We are managing with a small number of people.,4
We had a pleasant stay at all,4
We stayed at that hotel for 2 nights at the beginning of the month. Such a thoughtful design which makes life easier for travellers like us. Transportation was offered to areas of interest. The employees are probably the best we have ever encountered. Youll can easily walk in through the door open to Huis Ten Bosch.,5
"We stayed at the request of the child. It used cold water for cooling and was comfortable without getting too cold. On the other hand, the front desk, the rooms and the restaurant are not all connected, and the temperature difference is hot. It is necessary to go to the convenience store beside Huis Ten Bosch entry without being replaced by the vending machine, which is troublesome. There are many missing aspects. Breakfast was waiting for 40 minutes. Besides, only the rooms are under construction. Cost performance is also important, but if you dont care about it, you may even have to accept it as malicious. The next day, Hotel Nikko Huis Ten Bosch was comfortable.",3
We stayed at the seed of the story with six people. The room was spacious.,4
"We stayed here during the Kyushu Ichi Fireworks Festival. I had a small child, so it was convenient to move around because it was the closest place to the facilities where children can play in Huis Ten Bosch!",4
"We stayed in the E building. When I first entered, it smelled musty, and when I turned on the air purifier, I started sneezing. The filter is dusty. The air conditioner vent and the wooden wall of the room are full of mold. The bed board is also moldy and dusty... It was beautiful when I stayed a few years ago, but the cleaning condition is bad. It was hard because I have house dust allergy",1
"We stayed on the first floor of a two-story building. I couldnt stay comfortably because the voices from the rooms on the left and right at midnight were missing, and the footsteps were always reverberating. It is a hotel that can not praise anything except that the room is clean with a new construction. I will never stay at a hotel of this series again.",1
"We stayed on the way back from playing Huis Ten Bosch. At the time of check-in, I couldnt press the three-dimensional button properly, so I ended up calling the staff, but the child was delighted. Its close to Huis Ten Bosch, so it was great to be able to check in, take a short rest, and go see the illuminations. The room was simple but comfortable.",4
"We went with my husband and children to celebrate my birthday. Ive never had such a bad night. the beds are not designed for a tourist who arrives tired and wants to rest comfortably, on the contrary they are so hard that the tiredness and the terrible back and waist pain the next day were worse, also the pillows only one of them in each bed is soft , the other is the closest thing to a block. Although the hotel is nice but I do not recommend it!",1
"Weird weird but pleasant hotel. Its about a 10-minute walk from the departure hall, enough to walk, or there is a separate gate on the adventure park side. The only person I saw at checkout was the cleaning person. The own dining room included in the breakfast plan is also healthy and tidy! ... However, dont go to the Henna restaurant where robots cook in the main building.",5
What you want soberly costs money.,4
"When I go to a restaurant or hotel, I want to PAY MONEY in exchange for HOSPITALITY. Service : 1/5 … More",1
"When it rains, its hard to move outside to the accommodation building...",4
"With my wife on a wedding anniversary trip in December 2020, I was taken care of by the deluxe East Arm in 3 days and 2 nights. 【It was good point】 ・ Robot reception AR (Virtual Keyboard) with smoother response than expected I thought the check-in I used was hygienic. However, only the GoTo procedure was manned. ・ Face recognition It is convenient because you do not have to take out the card key each time. At the beginning of registration, authentication was NG several times and I used the card key. We were able to collate 100% on the 2nd and 3rd days. [Disappointing point] ・ Parking lot is charged (1,650 yen for 24 hours) The benefits for guests are about 20 minutes on foot More parking tickets at Huis Ten Boschs affiliated hotel parking lot You need to stamp the stamp on the hotel, so You will need to return to the hotel with your car in the parking lot. ・ No bed-making Maybe its a corona sickness, but towels, bathrobes, Toothpaste etc. will be replaced with new ones, but bed-making None, there was no change of sheets. ·toilet This is the most disappointing point. There is no tobira in the toilet and it is completely visible from the washroom Aside from business hotels, for family use, This division is a little troublesome. There is no deodorant on it, and it smells like a young couple. You may not be able to do large in the toilet in the room. ・ Huis Ten Bosch Gate The gate of Huis Ten Bosch is in front of the restaurant where you have breakfast There is. No guest benefits or proof is required, so in a strange hotel dedicated No, but there is no lighting, so it will be pitch black when the sun goes down. Im pretty scared so I went back from the bright exit of Hotel Nikko I walked back to the hotel for about 15 minutes. ・ Bars and shops Since it is unmanned, all accounting is by card or QR payment. The shop has goods with the hotel logo, but We have a small inventory of daily necessities and do not have local specialties. The bar is gimmick and interesting, but the beer is from the bottom of the cup The pouring shape will leak over time. [Overview] Except for the fact that the robot will accept it There are no noticeable points of differentiation, and honestly, I wonder if it will be used for the second time. I thought.",3
"Wonderful automation concept. Quick and easy check-in/out. However, space is small and basic. Its rather far from the theme park as well.",4
"You can experience different experiences such as robot reception, robot luggage reception, and unmanned convenience store. I think its fun to stay at such a hotel in an occasional theme park. The price is very reasonable and early park inn is also possible. The room itself is simple and there is a bath in the back of the toilet. There is a boiling pot, but if you buy coffee and tea at extra cost and do not enter, you will not leave it in the room itself. There is no need to keep in mind, as there are no fabries.",5
"You can fully understand the robot type in the Japanese concept. The overall planning of the hotel is very innovative. From the design institute facilities at the entrance, you can fully reflect the design concept of the hotel, from the luggage delivery, and even the control of the facilities in the room. Try to use robots and smart devices to complete. It has to be mentioned that the architectural design is very friendly to the environment, most of which are based on green energy, using solar energy to provide electricity, and the building materials are also designed with the concept of environmental protection. The robot service staff is very interesting, but the check-in process and method are slightly uncomfortable for foreigners. Of course, you can still call the human service staff to assist you. You can ask the robot to help you deliver luggage to the room. The room can also be in English or English. It is a Japanese control device. In addition, the restaurant of the hotel is also a very healthy concept, operating with the idea of ​​organic fruits and vegetables and food therapy.",4
"You can go to Huis Ten Bosch in about 3 minutes on foot + 15 minutes before admission to the park (and the entrance is close to shooting stars, etc. where waiting time often occurs), so staying one day before the entrance to Huis Ten Bosch is the most efficient It seems to be used. The hotel itself is not really popular, and if there are no other guests, you can spend time quietly in the lobby without worrying about the people. However, I was worried that it was difficult to find staff who could rely on them when something happened.",4
"You can register the key or face of the entrance of the new hotel, and the staff will take care of you if you do not know even if the entrance is non-contact, so you can rest assured. There is a charge for parking in front of the hotel. It is good to park at the free parking lot and pick up and drop off by bus. It is convenient to go down from the hotel to the entrance of Huis Ten Bosch.",4
"You can walk directly to Huis Ten Bosch, which is very convenient. The reception counter of the hotel is full of robots and dinosaurs. Children find it interesting. The room is not the width of a person, but the cleaning is very clean and comfortable. There are not many breakfast styles, and many people have to wait for a while.",4
"You may be a little confused at the time of check-in. Other than that, it is an ordinary business hotel. You will be walking outdoors from the front to the room. I think you need an umbrella on rainy days.",3
