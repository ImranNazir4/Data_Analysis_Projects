After you exit the app and then open it again, your projects are usually VERY LAGGY so it’s best to do everything in one go.

Whenever you create a project, it says you don’t have enough storage. I have a lot of storage and I’m still getting this error (even on a new phone). 

The only ways I can fix these issues is doing my projects in one go - which is quite hard if your doing a video/edit and you need more images. 

But besides those issues it’s a great app, no watermark.

-more custom 3D effects you can make one your own
- smooth slowmo 
-more effective effects for glitch style anime/kpop edits 
-actually smooth velocity station

That’s about it I haven’t used this app in months",Feature Request,Positive

Im Going To Try To Make This Review Easy To Read!:)

Ok so i think this is an AWESOME app its such a fun app, its so fun that i just try making random videos just so i can use the app!I 100% recommend this app its very entertaining to use and for people who dont wanna pay for “PREMIUM TO USE MUSIC” or “BUY PREMIUM SO YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE” this app is all free! And if people out there aren't trying to waste their money on some app then get CapCut! I absolutely L•O•V•E this app!

••••••••

You can use this app for so many different things but heres the part for my recommendations! 

RECOMMENDATIONS SECTION~~~

So I recommend that team CapCut to add more music options kinda like Spotify and I know thats a lot to ask for so maybe just like some more popular music! And maybe some old 90s music to! 

ENDING•

Thank you so much for reading my Review i hope this helped you decide whether you want to get this app or not! Thank you guys and thank you CapCut for creating such an amazing app-",Information Giving,Positive

It’s just kinda annoying just to get back out and in.",Information Giving,Positive

This is perfect, when I was using Kinemaster I had like 150 subscribers

10,518,CapCut - Video Editor,2021-04-02 15:32:01,4,"° Capcut is amazing is so many ways, it’s very accessible but in ways a bit laggy; today I was logging into to capcut for an edit, I went to effects and when I had choosed and set the duration for how long I wanted to for, I tried exiting the effects but it would deny that..I could of overcome my phone freezing but highly likely not because it was same with my brother, he had not be able to leave the filters meaning he had to refresh his phone, loosing his project...but overall Capcut is definitely recommended to those who are looking for editing apps! Another improvement is that people under 12 can use it, does no harm, in my opinion! Thank you for your time! <3 °",Information Giving,Negtive
