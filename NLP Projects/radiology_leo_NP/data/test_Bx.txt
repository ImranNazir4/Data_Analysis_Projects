CLINICAL HISTORY
Ulcer of right lower extremity, unspecified ulcer stage

SPECIMENS SUBMITTED:
A: RIGHT FOOT TRANSMETATARSAL AMPUTATION
B: PROXIMAL MARGIN OF 3RD DIGIT

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh in 2 parts, both labeled Mandarini, Louis and MRN 1183886:

A.  Received fresh labeled "right TMA foot" is a 7.0 x 7.0 x 4.0 cm right TMA
specimen consisting of 3 intact toes, in which the middle toe displays a flat
proximal bone resection margin, and the flanking toes display disarticulated
proximal margins.  The proximal soft tissue margin appears viable and is inked
black.  The epidermis displays a 6.0 x 2.5 cm tan-red, circumferential
ulceration on the middle toe.  Each toe displays a brown-gray toenail at the
distal aspect of the toe the remaining epidermis is tan-pink and wrinkled.  The
specimen is sectioned to reveal the trabeculated bone underlying the middle toe
ulceration is black-gray and softened surrounded by red-yellow, hemorrhagic soft
tissue.  The remaining flanking toes display yellow-pink, trabeculated bone
surrounded by cortical bone, averaging 0.1 cm.  Also received in the container
is a 7.3 x 5.2 x 2.0 cm aggregate of tan-yellow, bony tissue fragments with
attached tan-red, soft tissue, in which one of the bony tissue fragments
displays a metallic screw.  Photographs are taken representative and sections
are submitted as follows:

A1: Bone marrow from middle toe proximal bone resection margin
A2: Representative proximal soft tissue margin, en face
A3-A5: Representative ulceration of middle toe, to include involved underlying
bone, following decalcification

B.  Received fresh labeled "proximal margin of third digit (toe)" is a 0.8 x 0.5
x 0.3 cm tan-red, bony tissue fragment, which is wrapped and submitted in toto
in cassette B1, following decalcification.

A: SKIN EXCISION, RIGHT LOWER LEG

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh labeled Heney, Niall M, MRN 1791885 only is an unoriented 2.3 x
1.0 cm tan-white granular skin ellipse, excised to a depth of 1.2 cm.  No
discrete lesions are identified on the epithelial surface.  The specimen is
inked blue and serially sectioned to reveal a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm circumscribed
freely movable nodule with a solid dark brown cut surface in the subcutaneous
tissue, 0.1 cm from the closest inked margin.  Representative of the nodule is
allocated to the tissue bank per protocol Boland 11-181.  The remaining specimen
is entirely submitted in cassettes A1-A3 (en face tips in A1; remaining
subcutaneous nodule in A2).

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh labeled Eugene Marley, MRN 2090852, and "gallbladder" is a 10.0 x
6.5 x 5.0 cm previously disrupted, distorted gallbladder surfaced by abundant
adhesions and fat.  The grossly appreciable serosa is red-tan, dull with
scattered petechial hemorrhage.  There is exposed tan-white, fibrinous, necrotic
appearing debris on the surface of the specimen.  The specimen is opened to
reveal multiple ovoid, semibosselated, yellow choleliths measuring up to 2.3 cm
in greatest dimension occluding the gallbladder neck adjacent to the cystic
duct.  The fundus is markedly distorted and appears replaced by an abscess-like
cavity filled with red-tan to tan-white necrotic debris and exudate.  The wall
is fibrotic and ill-defined and ranges from <0.1-0.9 cm thick.  Representative
sections are submitted as follows:

A1: Cystic duct margin, en face

Surgical Pathology Report


Accession #: XS22-4266


FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

A. LEFT ILIAC BONE LESION, NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:  
Dense, sclerotic bone with thickened bony trabeculae, irregular cement lines and
mild reactive marrow fibrosis.  
See note.

Note: Immunostains for pankeratin Oscar and pankeratin AE1/AE3 (A1, A2) are
negative for metastatic carcinoma.  The findings are compatible with Paget's
disease of bone in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no evidence of
malignancy.  This case was reviewed at an intradepartmental consensus
conference.

Pathologist interpretation performed at Mass General Brigham Salem Hospital, 81
Highland Avenue, Salem, MA 01970.

Some processing of this specimen was performed at Salem Hospital, 81 Highland
Ave., Salem MA 01970, Lab Director Bruce Beckwith, MD.  Due to loss of elastic
tension and/or tissue shrinkage in formalin, the clinical sizes of tissue
specimens may be larger than those provided in this report.

Unless otherwise stated above and if applicable, immunostains were performed at
Salem Hospital. These tests were developed and their performance characteristics
were determined by Salem Hospital.  Assays may not have been validated in
decalcified tissues, and results in decalcified tissues should be interpreted
with caution.  The tests may not have been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, but the FDA has determined that such clearance or
approval is not necessary.  These tests are for clinical purposes and should not
be regarded as investigational.  Salem Hospital laboratory is accredited by the
College of American Pathologists, and is approved by CLIA for the performance of
high complexity testing.  Unless otherwise specified, all histochemical and
immunohistochemical controls are adequate.
