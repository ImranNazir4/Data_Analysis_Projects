,No,Anxiety issues getting out of control. Recently had extremely worrying and upsetting thoughts of what life is all about and life being a big illusion in my imagination.

"I've struggled with anxiety and depression since the age of 14/15, I've never been to get diagnosed out of fear of not being believed. ","I've had issues with anxiety which manifests in overthinking, paranoia, irrationality and situational agoraphobia. I also have issues with depression and have been entering states where i feel numb and everything feels pointless. I've had arguments with my boyfriend because I wont want to get out of bed or follow through with plans because there's no point to doing things because there's no point to existence. This leads to arguments and me saying things I don't believe, and has also led to me missing a lot of uni. 
I also find people really difficult to understand, in terms of body language and understanding sarcasm and being able to tell when people are joking or not. 
I also have lots of self esteem issues which mean I am not confident in myself or my actions which means I am constantly doubting everything I do which makes it 100% harder. 
Also I have had issues with identity and dysmorphia, which has shown itself in different ways such as constantly changing my appearance and having issues with control when it comes to food and eating. I have no clue what I actually look like (if that makes sense) because every time I look in the mirror it changes depending on my mental state. (eg looking much much much larger than I am when I'm in a worse place mentally)
I've also had issues with dissasociation, which isnt the worst thing because it made working at a fast food place more bearable because I wouldnt remember my shift by the time I got home, but sometimes I have increasing sensations of derealisation and depersonalisation which mean I miss entire conversations and sometimes hours of time without remembering what happened or feeling as though I'm actually participating in my own life.

1.	The MSc Level 7 study is a stretch for me.  I do not feel well aligned to the subject matter of Data Analytics Engineering.  Each unit on its own is within my reach, but combined I feel too stretched (Under strain).  When programming to the level of the MSc units it can take me many hours to come to a solution, leaving me disorientated physically for a while.
2.	Looking after my son can be a challenge sometimes. The thought of doing my dissertation during the summer school holidays, whist looking after him next year, feels totally impractical.
3.	Family pressures of elderly in-laws, with Vascular Dementia fluctuates. Crisis still happen, which involve stepping in.  This influences level of time & energy I can give to MSc.
4.	I am not enjoying the MSc.  No one’s fault.  Just the way it is.  
","Someone to talk to in reaching a decision on the study of MSc. It is important to me I reach a decision that is right for me.

I am happy to take the 60 credits I have achieved on this course and draw a line under it.

I am trained as a Wilderness First Responder, and so I got my medical kit from my room, ran back down and using my supplies and training applied a compression bandage to control his bleeding, getting my hands covered in his blood. I then assessed his level of awareness and orientation and concluded that he was A&O times 1 (minimally conscious and only able to respond non-verbally at that time). He had lost a massive amount of blood, much of which was pooled around his body, smeared on the glass door, and pooled in intervals along the path he took from where he was stabbed. I continued to assist him after the police arrived by trying to stop him from going into shock when the cut off his jacket by wrapping him in my space blanket.

However, I have become more aware of the competing demands on my time and while making good progress with my PhD, conscious that I have recently not dedicated as much time as I should to it.

It is not that I am aiming for perfection, but having people hate me for seemingly no reason is something that hurts.

"Have suffered with mental health issues, namely severe depression & anxiety since 2016. I was on Escitalopram 10mg (1 a day) from 2015 until May 2018, where I came off it. I also had an instance of self harm in April 2017. I've come a very long way since then, and now live a much more normal and calm life than I did - nowhere near as bad as it was. However, I think therapy & CBT will help me get over this final barrier.","Further to the above, I used to really struggle with anxiety and depression, and also self harmed in 2017. I've come a very long way from that - mainly through coming off my anti-depressants, establishing a solid routine, focusing on gym and physical fitness, going sober from smoking Weed, and utilising the amazing help of family and friends - however, I do still need help. I still have problems with my anxiety and depression in terms of how to deal with episodes, my self esteem is pretty low at the moment and I'm not as confident in social situations as I was. I also experience suicidal thoughts quite regularly (I would never do it, but it just comes into my head quite a lot - I would never take action on these, just they do pop up quite frequently which is out of my control). I also struggle with my routine and coming into Uni sometimes, I also sometimes have a problem with lying that I'd like to explore.","Ideally, if possible, I'd love to make use of the CBT/Therapy services as I believe this is one of the final things I need (the missing cog if you will) to progress down this stretch, which may even be the final stretch of my prevalent struggles (I hope). I've never properly utilised therapy and CBT, although I did do public group sessions through NHS Steps 2 Wellbeing which I didn't really get on with. Having had so much support from Uni, I'd really like to try out the CBT and therapy to make sure that I get through this year, and really progress mentally.","I do have thoughts about suicide semi-often, but I would never contemplate doing it - I am past that phase I think. They just pop into my head without my control, again I'm in no danger of doing it - but the fact that they do pop into my head is weird, I'm almost used to it now.","I have had thoughts in the past, serious ones when I was at my worst in the late 16/17 year and parts of the 17/18 year, but now I've progress it's not on that level now.

I need help with moving forward, and I think hypnotherapy would give me a solid platform to push on from.","It impacts on my life in a huge way, I've missed out on opportunities, ruined friendships and relationships and put extreme strain on those around me, but most of all myself.

"Depression and Anxiety : 2017, I went to my doctors and a doctor diagnosed me with anxiety, which was causing me a lot of trouble sleeping, and the lack of sleep and anxiety mixed together were making me feel depressed, and I was given Amitriptyline to try to help. probably the start of 2018 I saw my GP again and explained how I had gotten suicidal, I was then put on Setraline, I was also given leaflets for talking therapy but my anxiety always prevented me from going to sign up.","I tend to be really depressed a lot of the time and combined with my anxiety I find it really hard to sleep, I usually get a couple/few hours asleep a night. im either really low, not being able to eat, or be surrounded by friends as all I want to do is sit in bed and do nothing. I can't make phone calls to anyone as I have really bad anxiety about it, I fail to take opportunities I am given because im terrified of everything, its taken me a while to even attempt to seek help again because I've not had a great experience and its draining. I suffer from large chunks of emotional intensity, like ill either care way too much about things and then other times I won't care at all.","I really don't even know at this rate, I just want to do something that might lessen how I feel, because its just getting slowly worse and I think even just talking to someone might help.

Depression  - Circa 2000 – 2006ish                                       ,No,"I’m a mature student who 16 years ago had to drop out of the final year of my studies due to depression and to become the primary carer of a disabled parent. That depression had been brought on by the combination of a spectacularly soap opera worthy end of a relationship, the sudden death shortly after that of one of my closest friends who I talked to about those things, and the increasing issues of my mothers health and related matters.
I’ve been a carer for around 15 years, which, pretty much meant my social life reduced and got smaller while my friends grew up, moved on, and engaged with life.  My mother passed away, I’ve tried restarting my life but got somewhat burnt out on the job hunt going nowhere, I’ve had another significant relationship end, and I’ve just returned to university in an attempt to actually move on.
Over the past few months I;ve recognised I’ve been dancing around the lines of depression once more, I'd like to be pre-emptive in making sure it doesnt go further.","I’m nearly twice the age of pretty much all my current “peers” which makes it somewhat harder to engage socially with them. After 15 years as a carer, I’m a little socially withdrawn with a minimal support network. I have the occasional obsessive/circular thought process, along with the odd cognitive/emotional dissonance. I’ve been told I’m emotionally detached, I can bounce from fidgety to stillness. My sleep patterns can be a little off. I’ve “lost” half my life while everyone around me was moving on, and I do have that “who the hell am I now?”anxiety/question.","Not 100% sure to be fair.

But thats not the only time they made me feel neglected. Its a lot to process now the penny has finally dropped. I cant stop my self  from crying if i think of something that reminds me of them and this happens a lot. Its effecting my productivity SO much.

I also am worried about everything and because of this I hardly go out because I am worried about the possibilities of something going wrong. I think about death a lot but not in sense of suicide, I am terrified of death to the point where it controls my everyday thoughts. Just crossing a road for me is enough to make me think about how I could die, I even think about this on holidays. I also have trouble making decisions as I find myself struggling with the fact that I have to make a decision alone. I have also realized that even though I know my flatmates and I really like them that they aren't really close friend, I have nobody in my course who I talk too and I do everything alone.","It impacts me a lot, I find myself scared of going out and all the possibilities of me dying from something that could be so small.

I don't put myself out there, I am silent most of the time. I struggle relating to people. It makes it hard to talk to people. My fear of death means I am afraid of illness, some foods (I am terrified of food poisoning) and I am terrified of going out.

,I have extreme psychotic issues with not sleeping. I've been afraid of the dark & being alone in it/at night or trying to sleep alone forever...resulting in huge insomnia because i'm too afraid to let myself fall asleep or close my eyes -I keep myself awake until i can see sunrise or not be too scared to sleep. But sometimes even in daylight I struggle to let myself sleep because im too afraid if im alone. You may ask why am i afraid/what of? nothing to specific just intruders & paranormal stuff & monsters-I know it seems so embarrassing and babyish but I have such a vivid imagination that i just see these visions when im awake and cant stop imagining horrible scenarios or creatures trying to get me once im asleep or my eyes are shut. So hopefully a really good hypnotists could 'zap' me out of it and just tell me not to fight my tired urge and let myself sleep straight away and to not be scared. Im not bothered in finding out why im so scared or messed up i just know im sick of being like this at 20 years of age and the lack of sleep is making me ill...frequently,hypnotherapy and hopefully a mind-tricker /sessions of hypnosis that stops me being afraid at night so i can live my life normally and never have this problem again and i can just go to sleep like a normal person without even questioning it or forcing myself to stay awake.,"I've considered alcohol/drugs because I know i sleep straight away and great after a night out or if i've drunk some alcohol: so its tempting to do this every night but that would make my liver so bad and although its often a really nice good deep sleep i dont feel great in the morning and dont want to become an alcoholic to try and solve another problem of mine. 

I'm not suicidal anymore or particulary thinking of self-harm but obviously out of frustation from being up all night most nights you do jokingly sadly think sometimes that you wish you were dead because feeling so tired makes you feel pretty much corpse like.

I had breakdowns last year causing me to go home for a weeks at a time and wanting to quit uni. I got put on medication  for my anxiety and depression but I took myself off of the medication and didn't get the full effects as I wasn't taking them properly so I didn't really help myself in that sense. I used to go counselling when I was 16 for the same issues but that was also short term and didn't feel any full benefits from this. I like to go out a lot and when I do I find I am consuming huge amounts of alcohol and drugs, at these times is when I feel happiest which is not a healthy state to be in. Also this has become a weekly occurrence and I cant seem to help myself. I used to self harm and I have stupid, fleeting thoughts of suicide.

- At night I can feel dust and crumbs all over my body specifically my legs even though there is nothing there.
- I begin to panic whenever my pyjamas don't sit properly on my body for example, if they are too tight on my bottom or if the legs begin to ride up. It doesn't allow me to sleep until 6am sometimes. I change my clothing sometimes 10 times a night. 
- I constantly think of things and then I can't think of anything else until I do it. For example, my dad snores heavily at night and I can not sleep unless I know his door is shut. 
- Sound has begun to really effect me if something is too loud I can't think and begin to panic. 
- I have had passing suicidal thoughts when my anxiety is especially high or I can't deal with the problems during sleep. ",,,,"I would like to stop being unable to sleep.

I’m incredibly hard on myself and never accept praise- which alienates people around me.

,None,"I need help with coping with my anxiety. I have been struggling with it for 8-10 years now, and whilst is comes in waves, it is not going away.

It stops me from doing things like seeing my family, hanging out with friends, going to new places, and going to work. My main coping mechanism is to retreat, and this is holding me back from doing things that I should want to do and enjoy. 

I know what kind of things trigger my anxiety, but I’m not sure how to keep that under control. I am also unsure of why my anxiety ‘come in waves’ (I have good and bad days/weeks quite randomly). 

A GP, amongst other people, have recommended counselling to me, and I think I have spent a long time trying to cope with, or running away from, my anxiety on my own, and now I need some professional help. ","When my anxiety ‘spikes’ I don’t have a coping mechanism for it, and it effects every aspect of my life (work, study, social and day-to-day), and this makes it difficult to do otherwise ‘normal things’. 

For example, I have a job this summer working in a supermarket, and certain aspects of the job are leaving me on edge my entire shift, and I find I am forcing myself to do what I have to, rather than knowing it’s all just part of the job. It is exhausting. I simply cannot explain to my co-workers why I don’t like certain aspects of the job; it’s embarrassing. Coupled with that, I have a fear of getting things wrong, and that also triggers my anxiety. As I said before, my only coping mechanism is to retreat, and that is just not practical. ","I need a better way of coping with my anxiety and stresses. Things like hanging out with my friends, going to new places (like other peoples houses) and turning up for work, should not be as hard as it it. And whilst I want to do those things, my anxiety makes me want to literally run away from them.

I know the things that make me uncomfortable, but my friends who aren’t going through the same thing don’t understand that about me. If I also had a better understanding of my anxiety and how to cope with it, it would make it easier to explain to my friends when/why I am having a hard time.",,2,Graphic Design,25,1

I found this set off my anxiety and self-doubt even more and stopped attending the sessions.

In my head i talk to myself I start saying negative things to myself; when I’m alone I will repeat theses stamens out load I also start making up statements and put words into head when having conversations with people as I jump to my own conclusion and believe people are thinking negative things about me.

To not be afraid of breaking down in public. To be able to enjoy life again rather than just finding every problem with it and see myself in a better light and not look down on myself so much.,There have been many times I have considered suicide as one of my last options when dealing with depression as it seems there will be no end to it as things seem to continue to spiral out of control. I have planned out my  suicide but never gone through with it due to the pain I would be placing on my family and friends and I view this as a cruel and selfish thing to do to them.

"Depression, March 2016 - Was given Citalopram 10mg","Yes, growing up as a teenager, I've made numerous attempts on my life. What could be considered the first attempt was when I was around 14/15 or so when I deliberately overdosed on a variety of medication, from what I can barely recall the reason I did so was because I had a complete emotional breakdown at the time. The next attempt I can recall was when tried hanging myself when I was 17 (I think) after a mixture of stress, relationship troubles, emotional difficulty and a bunch of other internal issues. The next attempt I can recall was after drinking heavily at a party instead of heading home, I went to a bridge overarching a dual carriageway, pushed myself onto the railings and was so incredibly tempted to jump down into the traffic below. Aside from alcohol, the reason I did so was due to the other issues I've mentioned previously.","Because I can't keep going on like this. It's clear to me that I can't solve these problems myself, when I do it's usually in a way that is ultimately self destructive (drug abuse, self harm, etc). My solution seems to be that I have to run away from my issues but it's clear that doesn't solve anything, it only prolongs the suffering. I feel the path I'm walking is only going to lead to oblivion and I don't want that anymore. I want to be better.","It's affected my productivity with university because why work when I can just drink the assessment away? Yeah, it's clear that by heading down the downward spiral is only going to worsen my performance and spoil the whole reason I am here in the first place. 
On a similar note, it is terribly affecting the relationships I hold towards my friends, peers and a lesser note family. It feels at times like I'm this poison, a poison that the further you interact with it, the further the infection spreads. And I greatly fear that I'm only going to destroy the personal relationships I hold so dear to me just because of my own self-destructive tendencies. 
One final point is that in terms of my own physical health and lifestyle, I am literally killing myself. All the drinking, smoking, reckless spending and everything else, it isn't good for me. It's not good in the short run and it's not good in the long run.","At it's core, I would like the ability to regain control of my life and want to shape myself into a better person.

I got ""diagnosed"" with anxiety and depression in 2015, but I don't think I ever got it on paper from my doctor, and I don't feel like I actually got a real diagnose or the propper help.

I have also tried valium gotten from others just to deal with my anxiety. I also had times when I eat less because of my self-image. When I was around 15-17 I tried to eat as little as possible because I just wanted to be skinny and feel good about myself - It got so bad that i was 16/17 years old and only weighed 39kg, but then I saw the problem myself and started eating again.

But it goes up and down from every year, month and day. I have periods when it's worse and others where I haven't been thinking about it at all. Right now/ lately I have the thoughts a lot, but it have never been about ""how to kill myself "" or tried to do it - it have been more about me wanting to ""escape"" this life/world, not wanting to exist anymore and kind of more just hoping to die a ""natural/accidentally"" way - than attempting to do it myself.",,3,Illustration ,47,6

,"2 years ago, I was part of a crash where a bike tried to overtake me but crashed and the rider died graphically. After that I was told I'd receive some kind of counselling through where I worked at the time, but this never happened. Fast forward to now I sometimes feel like I didn’t really process it but rather repressed it. My emotion range is limited I find it hard to find things that make me feel happy. I have things I find myself wanting to do but I can't really say they make me happy as such. They just give me something to do to turn my brain off from thinking. Not really about the crash, which only very occasionally comes to mind unless I'm driving and a bike overtakes me, more just other bad things in the world. They don't even need to affect me directly. It could just be seeing a politician lying on TV or a sob piece about climate change etc. It's injustices that don't directly affect my life so shouldn't illicit such a negative emotional reaction. I also suffer from a short temper for minor things.

In other situation I have this unintentional apathy to things I hear that should upset me but don't.

I have trouble focusing on work where there isn't a clear method. My stability subject questions are easy to focus on as they're very procedural but with other subjects that are more knowledge / research based my mind tends to wonder and get distracted. I find myself researching something related but not what I need to be doing but reading that is somehow something my brain will happily focuses on. This isn't a big problem I only mention it in case it's a sign of something else.

I find myself putting undue attention or fixation on things that don't matter. Overthinking things like buying a phone case without looking into all the options or overthinking if it’s exactly what I want. It’s a £5 phone case, if its somehow wrong you can send it back even if you can’t it’s a fiver it will not affect your life to the amount that you need to overthink this much.
","I'm not 100% sure. I just know I haven't always been like this but I'm struggling to work out exactly whats wrong. I hope talking with someone might help me sort things out in my head or find out if anythings wrong with me and with that information make useful positive change in life moving forward.

I’ve been experiencing a very disruptive and stressful ongoing family crisis since the start of this academic year. My sister lives in Southampton with my gran who looks after her due to my mum’s mental state which has stopped me and her seeing her for the past 2-3 years, my dad is also absent due to the fact he lives over an hour away. My sister has been having very dark mental episodes which started in September where I went to A&E with her because she was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was hurting herself. I was the only one who went to the hospital with her. In November I was contacted by gran saying she was in hospital after taking an overdose, she was okay, but I stayed at the hospital with her for 2 days. Christmas was a very emotionally stressful time and in late January I got a call saying she was in hospital again but when I went there this time, she was having an anxiety-based meltdown which I had never seen before. I was there for over 24 hours then the situation spiralled for a few days and ended up with her staying in hospital for over a week. 
 Sorry for this long amount of context, but I have a bad past with depression & anxiety. I too have been in and out of hospital due to physical manifestations of what’s in my head. I managed to get though foundation year and work a job without too much upset, but I have not handled these recent events and university term work well at all. I have never properly spoken to anyone and have isolated myself from my own head and what’s going on around me. I’m feeling constantly low and don’t have any motivation. I don’t know what I need but have been referred to try and talk to someone about all this.

I have previously been told by several doctors that I show several sign of major depressive disorder or chronic depression. I must have first been told such in 2017 around November.,"Generally, I feel very split. I have a very bubbly and energetic personality, loads of ambitions and dreams, however my mental health interferes with everything. I stopped enjoying things that made me me, struggle to get out of bed, struggle to do normal day to day things, most days I won't eat anything until 6pm when I finally gain the courage to leave my room. I am not an anxious person whatsoever but my head definitely gets in the way of my social relationships. I have to stay busy all the time or asleep otherwise I don't feel safe within my own presence, similarly, I will either be completely numb and cold towards life and others or overly emotional and overwhelmed by a number of different things. I also dissociate a lot which is probably one of the things I struggle most with because most of the time I don't actually know if what I am experiencing is real or not which I fear may lead to impulsive decisions as I do not fear the consequences. Furthermore, whenever I am around people or even in lectures my mind will completely wonder and I will feel extremely out of body which is why I don't bother attending anymore. I have tried grounding techniques however many don't work and the ones that do can turn destructive very quickly. Furthermore, I am aware I sabotage myself in terms of my own recovery, I am fully aware and conscious of what I have to do to get better however I don't feel like there is a point in doing so, most of the time I just ignore any type of rational thinking and do whatever I feel like I want to do even if I don't really want to do it. ","Just to feel safe, although talking therapy and counselling has very rarely actually helped, the aftermath of it allows me to be in my own thoughts in a much safer way where I can come to terms with my own next steps whilst still ensuring I am being healthy. It also gives me a reason to get out of the house as I know if I didn't come to sessions my mother would worry even more. ","I do have a whole plan of how I would take my own life, during the 6 years I have been dealing with this it has been one of the most persistent issues I have had and ever since I started medication it actually stopped, until very recently. I do not self harm as I don't find that it helps me in any way, whenever I am upset I do feel the urge to drink to just get away from my emotions. The reason why I haven't attempted to kill myself yet is purely because I know I wouldn't fail if I tried, and I am not ready to give it all up yet. Although there is nothing in life that excites my mind deep down I know I am still the same ambitious person I used to be, and that I do still want to do all the things I planned to do with my family, and for my family.","I have reoccurring thoughts and dreams of suicide, approximately 2 to 3 times a week.",,1,Psychology Undergraduate,46,7

Part B,"I’ve had problems with my mental health since around 2015/16 and while it got better in between, from 2018 on it came back really heavy around the winter time. In 2015/16 it began with Depression and I went to two different therapists. But after it got better I stopped going, but in October 2018 it got pretty bad again. It also wasn’t Depression any more. I don’t really know how to describe it, I mean I kinda know but I find it hard to write. It is like I have another person or personality in my head/mind. I can hear them, feel them and for example while I used to self-harm because I didn’t know what to do or I felt depressed etc. now it’s not really me anymore but that thing in my head. In general because of this I have trouble concentrating and focusing a lot, I often need to distract myself and stuff. It’s so weird to write this.
Last summer I started to go to a new psychiatrist and talking about it helped I guess. And because it helped I thought this would maybe help as well. Also because I really don’t know what to do, it just feels like I don’t have full control I guess.

Oh and in case you are wondering, I just joined Solent as a 3rd year student this year, because I did my first two years at a college in Germany.

I just learned this in 2018, because my parents didn’t tell me about it and because shortly after the diagnosis it got better it became irrelevant. 

Also the psychiatrist I was with last year kind of came to the conclusion that it’s not really a personality disorder and not really schizophrenic I guess. We also did a ECG (I think that’s what is it called) which didn’t show anything not normal. I don't know if this is important, just thought I'd let you know.

When I'm around people, I always forget about my thoughts and problems. I am also a very co-dependent person so I would like to know how to enjoy my time alone instead if using it to overthink. 
One thing that I always think about is the way that I come across to other people around me. Depending on who I am with, I can be quite a loud person and I get worried that this may come across as annoying. I also struggle with my body image so I find myself comparing myself with others.

Whenever I have sleep paralysis now, I can see myself sleeping in bed but it's like my soul has left my body which makes me feel like I'm dead. I end up having trouble breathing but I try and tell myself to calm down which never works. When I do eventually wake up, I'm always sweating.

,"I currently experience persistent low moods, that can range from apathy to quite severe sadness.

I suffer from long Covid, especially the fatigue connected to it, which makes my overall energy levels and motivation very low. That causes me being not as active with my dissertation (due on 2nd September) as I should be, which makes me feel guilty, very stressed and anxious. I cannot even enjoy free time activities anymore, because all my thoughts are just: ""You should focus more on your dissertation, don't be so lazy!“ But I constantly feel too tired to put much effort into it and my hobbies don't even make me relaxed anymore because of all the guilty thoughts racing in my head, so even my free time feels like a chore. I feel like my heart is constantly racing and my stomach and chest is kind of squeezed, it feels like being in the ""fight or flight"" mode constantly which is draining my low energy even more. I also have trouble falling asleep even though I am so tired, it usually takes me between 1-3 hours because my mind keeps worrying. And when I finally do a bit of work, it makes me even more stressed because I feel like the workload is too much and there is no way I can do high-quality work with my stressed mindset, so I am at the point when I just want to pass even with the lowest pass grade but I am not even sure I can do that.","I would like to get some advice on how to manage my stress, anxiety and how to stop the negative self-talk in my head.

I'm also incredibly 'jumpy', perhaps skittish is the word.
Most of the time, I find it very hard to motivate myself to do anything. for example, it's difficult getting out of bed most days and I rarely feel like I have had enough sleep and I constantly find myself napping, usually every day for up to three hours. I then sleep for another 7+ hours at night. Sometimes I find it hard to get to sleep - this may be caused by napping in the day or to my thoughts not letting me sleep - usually I'm angry or overthinking certain situations. 
Situations I think of in my head sometimes feel like they're real and they make me feel very strong emotions - like anger or anxiety or sadness.

PMDD,I have a history of PMDD and my symptoms have recently become worse.

This week I had to see a doctor after finding blood in my stools and having stomach pains for 1 -2 weeks. She examined me and said I was constipated with hemorrhoids and recommended taking laxatives. At the same time, my period is due next week and one of my most extreme symptoms of PMDD is binge eating - which has probably caused me to become constipated. I have called in sick at work today because I have a severe headache, tummy pain and awful lower back pain where my kidneys sit which worrys me about the damage I am doing to my body because I can't control myself.

Again after my second child 2008 (medication)
I had a mental breakdown around 2012? Panic attack and hyperventilated.
I have struggled with SAD every year. (Undiagnosed)
I again got postnatal depression after my third child which I managed without tablets. I was on tablets but they made me manic so I decided that I would try to cope without them.
Have seen different doctors all the time so I don't feel like there is a single doctor who knows my history.

No,"I had a single session therapy about a week ago with a counsellor named Diane if I remember right. We've been discussing an issue I've been having with my relationship with my boyfriend for about a month now. As I've stated before a random flatmate had to move in his house because those were the circumstances back then and he turned out to be gay. 

Since I found out I can deal with my mental health andI've been experiencing high levels of jealousy to a point where it becomes toxic without a particular reason. I can't even enter my boyfriend's house without a desire to leave immediately or stay and cry instead. The house has turned into the darkest side of my mind. 

On top of that, I started feeling dependant on my boyfriend for my mood and general mental health and I'm experiencing hyperventilation or close to panic attack situations almost all the time when he's not around me. 

During the last session we discussed and found out how possibly the problem originated but now I feel hopeless and desperate to save my relationship because I can feel that I'm hurting my boyfriend constantly when I feel jealous. I can't recognise myself at this point and low self-esteem and confidence were not something common for me before that happened. ",I want to get back to my previous self because I'm in a loving relationship and I don't want to ruin it because of my unstable mental health. I want to stop seeing my boyfriend's house as trauma in my head and a forbidden place.

No diagnosis provided,"
It all began as tension and anxiety, provoked by my inability to sustain myself, due to the fact I wasn't able to find a job after the winter break. Then I started to feel nervous being around people, and I started isolating myself occasionally in order not to make my friends feel distressed or moody because of my problems.
 
The turning point when I realised I had a problem was after a talk with one of my flatmates and my mother. They told me that I look really anxious and asked me how do I feel. Then I wasn't able to answer. I only new that I don't feel ok, and it's now becoming a problem because I have absolutely no motivation for being productive, no matter if it comes to my studies or my social life. 

The main thing that worries me lately is my genuine fear of death. When I say fear i mean something more than that. I've had it since I was 8 but now sometimes when I think about this topic I see my life just passing for a second in my head and then when I see\feel the blank space after it I start shivering and I can't breathe properly for several seconds until this thought is out of my mind.

I don't really self harm but I've noticed that when I get angry I want to punch walls or through things maybe even hit my head, I feel like it's more simple things I don't notice like snapping an elastic band on my wrist which at first seems like fidgeting as I am a big fidgeter  but then I realise I am actually causing myself pain. I for the most part can control these outbursts of anger or urges to hurt myself but if I am particularly sad or stressed it becomes increasingly more difficult to control and I have to almost physically restrain myself. I never used to have thoughts of hurting people that I am aware of but recently I have been hurting people in my dreams, at first I wasn't too disturbed as it was people I did not like and I knew I wouldn't actually do anything in real life but then I hurt one of my friends in my dreams and they hadn't done anything to annoy me recently and that was quite disturbing and upsetting as I wish no ill will onto them.

,"I come from Greece and this is my first year here in England. However these ''difficulties'' started from last year. I have been living under a huge amount of stress and I don't know how to make things better in my life. This feeling has been haunting me. Although it pains me to actually say it, I think it has to do with my best friend and I. We came here together and we also live together. I'm starting to believe that this only made things worse. There has not been a time I haven't thought of the simplest action and how it's going to affect her. I never think of myself any longer.

On the other side, I never think I'm good enough. Whatever I do, it's just not enough. I've only been here for four months and seeing everyone so well adapted and ready, makes me feel like I will fail. I can't express myself in classes properly, and my English are not that bad.

I feel alone, and I'm scared. I don't want to be alone and I can't go back in Greece because I will disappoint my family. I have always been called immature by them (because I have a tendency to do things at my own pace), and this is my chance to prove them wrong (by studying for a course I really like), but I'm driving myself crazy. My best friend tries to be helpful and she success, but there are a lot of things that she wants from me too.

,"During my second academic year (September- until now) I have been experiencing and trying to deal with what I believe is anxiety and depression. I have never haver been diagnosed or have had a session with a counsellor or psychologist before. These problems have been caused by really toxic relationships with what I thought were friends, that are also course mates. One of this people was also a flat mate and the other two were ""friends"" in common so when the situation became more overwhelming I didn't have rest of it as this flatmate lived in the room opposite me, so I could hear their very loud conversations all the time and couldn't scape from them even in my room. I meet these people in the 1st academic year but we didn't became friends until the end of that year. During the summer I noticed that my flat mate wasn't answering my messages and when we started studies in September I realised that they were gossiping about me and discussed the conversations I had with them. As an out come of that, to be brief, they believed every thing my flat mate said and started bullying me in person and also through Facebook messenger. Though out that time I've feeling very depressive about what happened and continued to happened, as well as anxious about the next academic term. Then in christmas while being with my family I thought I was recovering, but then one of the ""friends"" started messaging me again which caused my problems to come back stronger and even worse being really close to commiting suicide. I have spoken about this with my family , but the depression and anxiety don't go away. One of the things that I've noticed is that I only seem to be happy for very shorts amounts of time while I'm with actual friends, but as soon as I get to my room everything comes back again. I spend the majority of the days doing nothing, just at bed. My room doest help either as not much natural light comes in and even the light bulb doesn't project much light, so my room is very dark."," I'd like someone to help me overcome depression and anxiety and if necessary diagnose me on anything I may have. Also, I forgot to add that sometimes I have difficulty concentrating and paying attention, which I have experienced since little, specially at school and high school and musical language in the conservatory, but specially at maths. I wonder if it is ADHD and Dyscalculia (which I think and hope that my inability to understand maths could be only due to my concentration problem and not actual Dyscalculia)","As a consequence to my depression and anxiety I eat all the time excessively, even when I am full, specially junk food, but more than anything Ice cream, there have been weeks when I have eaten a tub of 500 g of ice cream a day, and in some days 1 L in a day, which I don't know if it could be a food disorder."," I have had very thoughfull suicidal thoughts, but have never harmed myself.",,2,Acting and Performance,47,3

I have trouble sleeping, eating, working, I detach myself from everyone in my life and from life itself. I think that I'm also experiencing OCD symptoms. I have rituals; I check, I count, I take pictures, I take notes, etc. This causes some level of anxiety. I also have no motivation and find it hard to engage in life.
