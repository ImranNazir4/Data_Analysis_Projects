90,"I've had issues with anxiety which manifests in overthinking, paranoia, irrationality and situational agoraphobia. I also have issues with depression and have been entering states where i feel numb and everything feels pointless. I've had arguments with my boyfriend because I wont want to get out of bed or follow through with plans because there's no point to doing things because there's no point to existence. This leads to arguments and me saying things I don't believe, and has also led to me missing a lot of uni. 
I also find people really difficult to understand, in terms of body language and understanding sarcasm and being able to tell when people are joking or not. 
I also have lots of self esteem issues which mean I am not confident in myself or my actions which means I am constantly doubting everything I do which makes it 100% harder. 
Also I have had issues with identity and dysmorphia, which has shown itself in different ways such as constantly changing my appearance and having issues with control when it comes to food and eating. I have no clue what I actually look like (if that makes sense) because every time I look in the mirror it changes depending on my mental state. (eg looking much much much larger than I am when I'm in a worse place mentally)
I've also had issues with dissasociation, which isnt the worst thing because it made working at a fast food place more bearable because I wouldnt remember my shift by the time I got home, but sometimes I have increasing sensations of derealisation and depersonalisation which mean I miss entire conversations and sometimes hours of time without remembering what happened or feeling as though I'm actually participating in my own life. ,I just want some help, I have tried going to cbt at my college which didnt work, possibly through me not knowing enough about me and my issues to eloquate them properly, and I've tried going to the drs but they sent me to an online chatroom to talk to people.

Right now i'm having a lot of trouble with some toxic friends that left me last year and are now stalking my social media accounts and generally making me really paranoid. Due to the nature of the friends etc i'm not really able to talk to anyone about the issues, and the entire experience has made me extremely paranoid and unable to trust anyone with knowing about it to begin with. So I need someone to vent to pretty much.,I had to delete a couple social media accounts, I still have nightmares about them even though it's been nearly over a year ago, we share a lot of friends so i'm constantly paranoid that they're going to say things and my current friends are going to suddenly leave me. It's made me unable to vent on social media because they look for it and i've been subtly threatened with public slander in the form of a callout-post 'exposing' me for the things they're lying about me doing.
I also can't vent to friends about it anymore due to the nature of the situation and who the people are, a couple of the people let me vent to them and acted like they were supporting me and then turned around and told everyone how awful it was that i was doing that. We're in a very similar social circle and i'm honestly quite scared of ever seeing them in person again especially after the stalking on social media. ,Someone to vent to, someone to reassure me that what they're doing is not okay and give me advice on what to do about it. ,no infom"

141,"I would like to talk before reaching a decision on Withdrawal from the MSc.
1.	The MSc Level 7 study is a stretch for me.  I do not feel well aligned to the subject matter of Data Analytics Engineering.  Each unit on its own is within my reach, but combined I feel too stretched (Under strain).  When programming to the level of the MSc units it can take me many hours to come to a solution, leaving me disorientated physically for a while.
2.	Looking after my son can be a challenge sometimes. The thought of doing my dissertation during the summer school holidays, whist looking after him next year, feels totally impractical.
3.	Family pressures of elderly in-laws, with Vascular Dementia fluctuates. Crisis still happen, which involve stepping in.  This influences level of time & energy I can give to MSc.
4.	I am not enjoying the MSc.  No oneâs fault.  Just the way it is.  
,Someone to talk to in reaching a decision on the study of MSc. It is important to me I reach a decision that is right for me.
â¨I appreciate all the support from the University course leader & lecturers, but after discussing this with family & friends & University support I feel the right action for me at this time is to Withdraw from the course.  I am happy to take the 60 credits I have achieved on this course and draw a line under it.
Iâve learned a valuable set of lessons.  Research this size of commitment more carefully in the future.

I've come a very long way from that - mainly through coming off my anti-depressants, establishing a solid routine, focusing on gym and physical fitness, going sober from smoking Weed, and utilising the amazing help of family and friends - however, I do still need help. I still have problems with my anxiety and depression in terms of how to deal with episodes, my self esteem is pretty low at the moment and I'm not as confident in social situations as I was. I also experience suicidal thoughts quite regularly (I would never do it, but it just comes into my head quite a lot - I would never take action on these, just they do pop up quite frequently which is out of my control). I also struggle with my routine and coming into Uni sometimes, I also sometimes have a problem with lying that I'd like to explore.,Ideally, if possible, I'd love to make use of the CBT/Therapy services as I believe this is one of the final things I need (the missing cog if you will) to progress down this stretch, which may even be the final stretch of my prevalent struggles (I hope).

Having had so much support from Uni, I'd really like to try out the CBT and therapy to make sure that I get through this year, and really progress mentally.,I do have thoughts about suicide semi-often, but I would never contemplate doing it - I am past that phase I think. They just pop into my head without my control, again I'm in no danger of doing it - but the fact that they do pop into my head is weird, I'm almost used to it now.,I have had thoughts in the past, serious ones when I was at my worst in the late 16/17 year and parts of the 17/18 year, but now I've progress it's not on that level now.

I need help with moving forward, and I think hypnotherapy would give me a solid platform to push on from.,It impacts on my life in a huge way, I've missed out on opportunities, ruined friendships and relationships and put extreme strain on those around me, but most of all myself. I owe it to myself to really make a difference and be the best I can be.,I'm currently in a very agitated state of mind, and I believe hypnotherapy would massively help with that, as well as helping with the issues I've mentioned above.

381,"No,Iâm a mature student who 16 years ago had to drop out of the final year of my studies due to depression and to become the primary carer of a disabled parent. That depression had been brought on by the combination of a spectacularly soap opera worthy end of a relationship, the sudden death shortly after that of one of my closest friends who I talked to about those things, and the increasing issues of my mothers health and related matters.
Iâve been a carer for around 15 years, which, pretty much meant my social life reduced and got smaller while my friends grew up, moved on, and engaged with life.  My mother passed away, Iâve tried restarting my life but got somewhat burnt out on the job hunt going nowhere, Iâve had another significant relationship end, and Iâve just returned to university in an attempt to actually move on.
Over the past few months I;ve recognised Iâve been dancing around the lines of depression once more, I'd like to be pre-emptive in making sure it doesnt go further.,Iâm nearly twice the age of pretty much all my current âpeersâ which makes it somewhat harder to engage socially with them. After 15 years as a carer, Iâm a little socially withdrawn with a minimal support network. I have the occasional obsessive/circular thought process, along with the odd cognitive/emotional dissonance. Iâve been told Iâm emotionally detached, I can bounce from fidgety to stillness. My sleep patterns can be a little off. Iâve âlostâ half my life while everyone around me was moving on, and I do have that âwho the hell am I now?âanxiety/question.,Not 100% sure to be fair. Someone to engage with, a means of verbalising it all. An experiment in resocialisation. A way to make sure I donât actually fall off the motivational wagon and find myself screwing up because I get lost in depression once more. Steps on the path to finding a way back into life without always just putting on a mask of charm and occasional wit. It just seems a tad better idea to try something rather than nothing.,no infom"

I've been afraid of the dark & being alone in it/at night or trying to sleep alone forever...resulting in huge insomnia because i'm too afraid to let myself fall asleep or close my eyes -I keep myself awake until i can see sunrise or not be too scared to sleep. But sometimes even in daylight I struggle to let myself sleep because im too afraid if im alone. You may ask why am i afraid/what of? nothing to specific just intruders & paranormal stuff & monsters-I know it seems so embarrassing and babyish but I have such a vivid imagination that i just see these visions when im awake and cant stop imagining horrible scenarios or creatures trying to get me once im asleep or my eyes are shut. So hopefully a really good hypnotists could 'zap' me out of it and just tell me not to fight my tired urge and let myself sleep straight away and to not be scared. Im not bothered in finding out why im so scared or messed up i just know im sick of being like this at 20 years of age and the lack of sleep is making me ill...frequently,hypnotherapy and hopefully a mind-tricker /sessions of hypnosis that stops me being afraid at night so i can live my life normally and never have this problem again and i can just go to sleep like a normal person without even questioning it or forcing myself to stay awake.,I've considered alcohol/drugs because I know i sleep straight away and great after a night out or if i've drunk some alcohol: so its tempting to do this every night but that would make my liver so bad and although its often a really nice good deep sleep i dont feel great in the morning and dont want to become an alcoholic to try and solve another problem of mine.

Because of this Iâm worried that my mental health may deteriorate the same way Iâve seen it happen with my family members. Throughout my life there has been quite a few traumatic situations, and I have had counselling before for two certain events however unfortunately I found it to not be very helpful as it only targeted one event which I found did not have much of an impact on me.

Long bad history with my mum as a child, she abused drugs and alcohol use and I had a restraining order against her as a child for a small amount of time. She has no parental rights for my or my little sister.
I sometimes have outbursts of anger I have tried to control over time and have tried to understand my emotions. I can be very impulsive and struggle to look after myself somedays, whereas other days I do perfectly well."
726,"Yes, growing up as a teenager, I've made numerous attempts on my life. What could be considered the first attempt was when I was around 14/15 or so when I deliberately overdosed on a variety of medication, from what I can barely recall the reason I did so was because I had a complete emotional breakdown at the time. The next attempt I can recall was when tried hanging myself when I was 17 (I think) after a mixture of stress, relationship troubles, emotional difficulty and a bunch of other internal issues. The next attempt I can recall was after drinking heavily at a party instead of heading home, I went to a bridge overarching a dual carriageway, pushed myself onto the railings and was so incredibly tempted to jump down into the traffic below. Aside from alcohol, the reason I did so was due to the other issues I've mentioned previously.,Because I can't keep going on like this. It's clear to me that I can't solve these problems myself, when I do it's usually in a way that is ultimately self destructive (drug abuse, self harm, etc). My solution seems to be that I have to run away from my issues but it's clear that doesn't solve anything, it only prolongs the suffering. I feel the path I'm walking is only going to lead to oblivion and I don't want that anymore.

- My father and i had an argument, when he refused to be my garuntaur for accommodation, and due to lack of wanting to go back into shared living due to prior experience, left me with nowhere to live.

I've been trying to understand why or to what extent I feel out of touch and I can't quite comprehend it, which is part of the main problem, I found some of my feelings to be similar to when a word looses meaning after saying it for too long, I think it's fatigue but most guesses feel the same, there are bits and pieces of my internal compass still missing, meaning that I find myself doubting about how I feel about concepts a lot more, to the point I can't reach conclusions by just thinking about it, I find myself thinking like I would on a dream where I'm conscious about dreaming, also similar to having many drinks and being tired, but sobering up, washed out, or at least that's what I think, I can't quite compare them in my head yet since I'm in such a strange state of mind. I might be miscalculating. also, I feel like I can't know for sure when I'm gonna be hungry or tired on the day or what could make me feel better, or even how I compare to feelings that I had in the past, if only a couple of hours apart, like my insights or self knowledge are very weak, and mostly connected by logic and memory instead of a more natural ''I just know'' manner.
The problem is first of all, my distress since I don't know what is going on and even if it is getting better, I just assume it will, and that it just me being mentally exhausted, still depersonalising, or both, secondly it gets really hard to functions since I feel like I'm on a completely different dimension every couple of hours.,Helping me understand my situation since I'm running on a series of unreliable guesses, tools to help me function and a structure for me to get my life back safely.,I'm just a mess, I don't think I'm gonna harm myself or others, If I, let's say, have a problem not eating properly, it would come from me not being able to identify when I'm hungry or anxious, or if I ate too much or too little, if I don't write it down it will loose track, same with sleeping too much or too little, I will not make my situation worse or self harm on purpose, but I could see myself being incompetent enough to set back my own recovery,None,no infom"

1132,"Generally, I feel very split. I have a very bubbly and energetic personality, loads of ambitions and dreams, however my mental health interferes with everything. I stopped enjoying things that made me me, struggle to get out of bed, struggle to do normal day to day things, most days I won't eat anything until 6pm when I finally gain the courage to leave my room. I am not an anxious person whatsoever but my head definitely gets in the way of my social relationships. I have to stay busy all the time or asleep otherwise I don't feel safe within my own presence, similarly, I will either be completely numb and cold towards life and others or overly emotional and overwhelmed by a number of different things. I also dissociate a lot which is probably one of the things I struggle most with because most of the time I don't actually know if what I am experiencing is real or not which I fear may lead to impulsive decisions as I do not fear the consequences. Furthermore, whenever I am around people or even in lectures my mind will completely wonder and I will feel extremely out of body which is why I don't bother attending anymore. I have tried grounding techniques however many don't work and the ones that do can turn destructive very quickly. Furthermore, I am aware I sabotage myself in terms of my own recovery, I am fully aware and conscious of what I have to do to get better however I don't feel like there is a point in doing so, most of the time I just ignore any type of rational thinking and do whatever I feel like I want to do even if I don't really want to do it. ,Just to feel safe, although talking therapy and counselling has very rarely actually helped, the aftermath of it allows me to be in my own thoughts in a much safer way where I can come to terms with my own next steps whilst still ensuring I am being healthy. It also gives me a reason to get out of the house as I know if I didn't come to sessions my mother would worry even more. ,I do have a whole plan of how I would take my own life, during the 6 years I have been dealing with this it has been one of the most persistent issues I have had and ever since I started medication it actually stopped, until very recently.
